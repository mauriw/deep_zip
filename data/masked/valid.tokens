= Homarus [MASK] = Homarus gammarus , known as the [MASK] lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , [MASK] Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is [MASK] related to the American lobster , H. [MASK] . It may grow to a [MASK] of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 [MASK] ( 13 lb ) , and bears a [MASK] pair of claws . In life , the [MASK] are blue , only [MASK] " lobster red " on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , [MASK] eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before [MASK] into <unk> larvae . Homarus [MASK] is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using [MASK] pots , mostly around the British Isles . = = [MASK] = = Homarus [MASK] is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 [MASK] ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 [MASK] ( 11 – 13 lb ) , [MASK] the lobsters caught in lobster pots are [MASK] 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and [MASK] 0 @.@ 7 – 2 [MASK] 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other [MASK] , lobsters have a hard [MASK] which they must shed in order to grow , in a [MASK] called <unk> ( <unk> ) . This may occur [MASK] times a year for young lobsters , but [MASK] to once every 1 – 2 years for larger [MASK] . The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , [MASK] pair of claws . The [MASK] one is the " <unk> " , and has rounded <unk> used for [MASK] prey ; the other is the " [MASK] " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for [MASK] or [MASK] the prey . Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the [MASK] . The <unk> is [MASK] blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . The red colour [MASK] with [MASK] only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red [MASK] <unk> is bound to a [MASK] complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , [MASK] the red pigment . The closest [MASK] of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus [MASK] . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed [MASK] , although hybrids are [MASK] to occur in the wild since their ranges do not [MASK] . The two species can be distinguished by a number of [MASK] : The <unk> of H. [MASK] bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. [MASK] . The spines on the claws of H. [MASK] are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. [MASK] are white or white @-@ tipped . The [MASK] of the claw of H. [MASK] is orange or red , while that of H. [MASK] is creamy white or very pale red . = = Life cycle = = Female H. [MASK] reach sexual [MASK] when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , [MASK] males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating [MASK] occurs in summer between a [MASK] <unk> female , whose shell is [MASK] soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female [MASK] the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the [MASK] , attached to her <unk> . Females [MASK] eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found [MASK] the year . The eggs hatch at night , and the [MASK] swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean [MASK] , preying on <unk> . This stage [MASK] three <unk> and [MASK] for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the [MASK] takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> [MASK] . The [MASK] are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , [MASK] they are known to be capable of digging [MASK] burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 [MASK] to the <unk> phase . When they reach a [MASK] length of 15 mm ( 0 [MASK] 59 in ) , the [MASK] leave their burrows and start their adult lives . = = [MASK] = = Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern [MASK] Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not [MASK] the Baltic Sea . It is also [MASK] in most of the [MASK] Sea , only missing from the section east of [MASK] , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The <unk> [MASK] are found in the [MASK] <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . The [MASK] can be divided into four [MASK] distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective [MASK] sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local [MASK] . The first of these is the [MASK] of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been [MASK] to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " . The [MASK] in the [MASK] Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the [MASK] : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those [MASK] in the North Sea or English Channel . [MASK] have been made to [MASK] H. gammarus to New Zealand , [MASK] other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> . [MASK] 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were [MASK] from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become [MASK] there . = = Ecology = = Adult H. gammarus live on the [MASK] shelf at [MASK] of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , [MASK] not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They [MASK] hard [MASK] , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or [MASK] , emerging at night to feed . The diet of H. [MASK] mostly consists of other <unk> [MASK] . These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and [MASK] worms . The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. [MASK] and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known [MASK] of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. [MASK] has not been described . Homarus gammarus is [MASK] to the [MASK] <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Although it is [MASK] found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H.

It may fetch very high [MASK] and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or [MASK] . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain " [MASK] " white meat , and most of the contents of the [MASK] are edible . The [MASK] are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . The [MASK] of H. [MASK] is up to three times higher than that of H. [MASK] , and the European species is [MASK] to have a better flavour . <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , [MASK] lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> [MASK] succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be [MASK] in a net or by [MASK] . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. [MASK] were caught across Europe and North Africa , of [MASK] 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( [MASK] the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. [MASK] is a [MASK] length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . <unk> systems for H.

H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as [MASK] by Direction 51 of the [MASK] Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that [MASK] , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several [MASK] names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus [MASK] H.

These [MASK] put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk . Since the <unk> was [MASK] designated as a threatened species , [MASK] groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek [MASK] . Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land [MASK] identified damaged [MASK] zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . [MASK] 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put [MASK] to create more pools in the [MASK] , and fencing was added to protect [MASK] zones from grazing . Next , the [MASK] sought to reform land @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and [MASK] project . As [MASK] pressed the <unk> to close much of the <unk> Creek Mountains to grazing , [MASK] ranchers joined the <unk> [MASK] seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . [MASK] , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals [MASK] lasting decades . However , in 1988 , [MASK] groups [MASK] all sides of the issue joined to form the <unk> Creek [MASK] Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution [MASK] to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's [MASK] health and [MASK] ' economic needs .

Two rival communist @-@ backed black [MASK] groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the [MASK] and introduce majority rule : the Chinese @-@ aligned [MASK] African National Union ( <unk> ) , mostly [MASK] <unk> , created the Zimbabwe African National [MASK] Army ( ZANLA ) and adopted aspects of <unk> doctrine , while the <unk> @-@ [MASK] Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( <unk> ) , [MASK] with Soviet @-@ style <unk> – <unk> and the [MASK] Pact , mobilised the Zimbabwe People 's [MASK] Army ( <unk> ) .

Around the same time , [MASK] 's other main <unk> , South Africa , adopted a <unk> [MASK] that forced a ceasefire , giving the [MASK] time to regroup .

The [MASK] of <unk> began a continuous curve of growth starting in the <unk> Period ( [MASK] 2000 BC – AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late [MASK] with the [MASK] growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , [MASK] by a sharp decline . For the 120 square [MASK] ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the <unk> defenses of the [MASK] , the peak [MASK] is estimated at <unk> per square kilometer ( <unk> per [MASK] mile ) .

These [MASK] figures are even more [MASK] because of the extensive <unk> that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . However , some [MASK] , such as David [MASK] , believe these figures to be far too high . = = Rulers = = The [MASK] line of <unk> , [MASK] as early as the 1st century AD , spanned 800 years and [MASK] at least 33 rulers . = = [MASK] = = = = = <unk> = = = There are [MASK] of early [MASK] at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC , in the [MASK] <unk> . A <unk> of <unk> [MASK] dating from about 700 @-@ 400 BC were found in a sealed <unk> , a [MASK] bottle @-@ shaped chamber . Major [MASK] at <unk> was already taking place in the Late <unk> period , first [MASK] around 400 – 300 BC , [MASK] the building of major pyramids and [MASK] , although the city was still <unk> by sites [MASK] north such as El <unk> and <unk> . At this time , <unk> [MASK] in the widespread <unk> culture that [MASK] the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that [MASK] the entire <unk> [MASK] including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize . Two [MASK] dating to Late <unk> times had [MASK] @-@ walled <unk> that may have been <unk> @-@ vaulted , [MASK] this has not been proven . One of these had [MASK] paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a <unk> [MASK] , painted in yellow , [MASK] , pink and red . In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeared and <unk> [MASK] a [MASK] and cultural <unk> as its giant northern neighbors declined . At the end of the Late [MASK] , the <unk> style art and [MASK] from the Pacific Coast began to influence <unk> , as [MASK] by a broken sculpture from the <unk> and early [MASK] at the city . = = = Early Classic = = = <unk> [MASK] among the [MASK] Maya is most deeply rooted at <unk> . According to later [MASK] records , the dynasty was [MASK] by <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , perhaps in the 3rd century AD . At the [MASK] of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was [MASK] at [MASK] and <unk> , in the core of the Maya <unk> . <unk> may have [MASK] from the collapse of the large <unk> [MASK] such as El <unk> . In the Early Classic <unk> rapidly [MASK] into the most dynamic city in the Maya region , <unk> the [MASK] of other nearby Maya cities . The site , [MASK] , was often at war and [MASK] tell of <unk> and conflict with other Maya states , [MASK] <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The site was [MASK] at the end of the Early [MASK] by <unk> , which rose to take <unk> 's place as the [MASK] center in the [MASK] Maya lowlands . The earlier part of the Early Classic saw [MASK] between <unk> and its neighbor <unk> , with <unk> [MASK] the capture of prisoners from <unk> . There appears to have been a [MASK] in the male [MASK] by AD 317 , when Lady <unk> <unk> conducted a <unk> @-@ ending ceremony , [MASK] as [MASK] of the city . = = = = <unk> and <unk> = = = = The [MASK] king of <unk> was <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak ( Great [MASK] <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak built a [MASK] that was [MASK] and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central [MASK] . Little is known about <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak [MASK] that he was killed on 14 [MASK] <unk> AD . On the same day , [MASK] K ’ <unk> ’ ( Fire Is Born ) [MASK] from the west , having passed through El Peru , a site to the west of [MASK] , on 8 [MASK] . On Stela 31 he is [MASK] as " Lord of the West " . <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ was [MASK] a foreign general serving a figure [MASK] by a non @-@ Maya <unk> of a <unk> [MASK] with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great [MASK] of <unk> in the [MASK] Valley of Mexico . <unk> Owl may even have been the ruler of <unk> . These [MASK] events [MASK] suggest that <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ led a <unk> [MASK] that defeated the native <unk> king , who was captured and [MASK] executed . <unk> K <unk> ' appears to have been aided by a powerful [MASK] faction at <unk> itself ; [MASK] at the time of the conquest , a group of <unk> natives were [MASK] residing near the Lost World [MASK] . He also exerted control over other cities in the area , [MASK] <unk> , where he [MASK] king , but did not take the throne of <unk> for [MASK] . Within a year , the son of [MASK] Owl by the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> I ( First [MASK] ) had been installed as the [MASK] king of <unk> while he was still a boy , being [MASK] on 13 September <unk> . He [MASK] for 47 years as king of <unk> , and [MASK] a vassal of <unk> K <unk> ' for as long as the [MASK] lived . It seems likely that [MASK] <unk> <unk> I took a wife from the <unk> , [MASK] , <unk> dynasty and thus <unk> the [MASK] to rule of his son , <unk> Chan K [MASK] II . <unk> <unk> , a small site 100 [MASK] ( 62 mi ) northeast of <unk> , was [MASK] by the latter during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The site became an [MASK] of <unk> , [MASK] it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the [MASK] . Although the new rulers of <unk> were foreign , their [MASK] were [MASK] <unk> . <unk> became the key ally and trading partner of <unk> in the Maya [MASK] . After being [MASK] by <unk> , <unk> rapidly dominated the northern and eastern <unk> . <unk> , [MASK] with smaller towns in the region , were [MASK] into <unk> 's kingdom . [MASK] sites , such as <unk> and <unk> de San José near Lake <unk> <unk> became [MASK] of their more [MASK] neighbor to the north . By the middle of the 5th century <unk> had a core [MASK] of at least 25 [MASK] ( 16 mi ) in every direction . Around the 5th century an impressive system of [MASK] [MASK] of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of <unk> 's [MASK] , joining up with the natural [MASK] provided by large areas of <unk> lying to the east and west of the city . Additional [MASK] were [MASK] also built to the south . These defenses protected <unk> 's core population and [MASK] resources , <unk> an area of [MASK] 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) . Recent research suggests that the [MASK] served as a water [MASK] system rather than a defensive purpose . = = = = [MASK] and <unk> = = = = In the 5th [MASK] the power of the city [MASK] as far south as <unk> , whose founder K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' was [MASK] [MASK] with <unk> . <unk> itself was not in an [MASK] Maya region and the founding of the <unk> dynasty probably involved the direct [MASK] of <unk> . K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' [MASK] in <unk> in [MASK] 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his [MASK] and youth at <unk> . An [MASK] known as <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' ( lord K <unk> ' Mo ' ) is [MASK] to in an [MASK] text at <unk> and may well be the same person . His tomb had <unk> [MASK] and he was depicted in later [MASK] dressed in the warrior [MASK] of <unk> . <unk> texts refer to him as " Lord of the West " , much like [MASK] K ’ [MASK] ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , <unk> [MASK] the nearby site of <unk> , possibly [MASK] by <unk> itself . The founding of these two [MASK] may have been part of an effort to impose <unk> 's authority upon the [MASK] portion of the Maya region . The [MASK] between these sites and <unk> was intense over the next three [MASK] . A long @-@ [MASK] rivalry between <unk> and <unk> began in the 6th [MASK] , with each of the two cities forming its own network of [MASK] hostile <unk> <unk> [MASK] each other in what has been likened to a long @-@ [MASK] war between two Maya <unk> . The kings of these two [MASK] adopted the title <unk> ' , a term that has not been precisely [MASK] but that implies [MASK] akin to " high king " . The early 6th [MASK] saw another queen ruling the city , [MASK] only as the " Lady of <unk> " , who was very likely a [MASK] of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II . She [MASK] never to have ruled in her own right , rather being [MASK] with male co @-@ [MASK] . The first of these was <unk> ' B [MASK] , who seems to have had a long career as a general at <unk> before [MASK] co @-@ ruler and 19th in the [MASK] sequence . The Lady of <unk> [MASK] seems not have been counted in the dynastic [MASK] .

The " <unk> hiatus " refers to a period [MASK] the late 6th to late 7th [MASK] where there was a lapse in the writing of [MASK] and large @-@ scale [MASK] at <unk> . In the latter half of the 6th [MASK] AD , a serious crisis <unk> the city , with no new stelae being erected and with [MASK] [MASK] mutilation of public sculpture . This hiatus in activity at <unk> was long [MASK] until later <unk> <unk> identified that the period was prompted by <unk> 's [MASK] defeat at the hands of <unk> and the <unk> [MASK] in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have [MASK] in the capture and [MASK] of the king of <unk> . The badly eroded Altar 21 at <unk> [MASK] how <unk> suffered this [MASK] defeat in a major war in [MASK] 562 . It seems that <unk> was an ally of <unk> in the wider [MASK] between that city and <unk> , with the defeat of <unk> having a [MASK] [MASK] upon the city . <unk> was not sacked but its power and [MASK] were broken . After its great [MASK] , <unk> grew rapidly and some of <unk> 's [MASK] may have been forcibly relocated there . During the [MASK] period , at least one ruler of <unk> took refuge with <unk> ' <unk> of [MASK] , another of <unk> 's [MASK] . <unk> itself <unk> during <unk> 's long hiatus period . The [MASK] of the <unk> hiatus has served as a marker by which [MASK] commonly <unk> the Classic period of <unk> [MASK] into the Early and Late [MASK] . = = = = <unk> and <unk> <unk> = = = = In <unk> <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> , some 110 [MASK] ( 68 mi ) to the [MASK] , as a military outpost in order to [MASK] trade along the course of the <unk> River . B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was [MASK] on the throne of the new [MASK] at the age of four , in 635 , and for many years [MASK] as a loyal vassal [MASK] for his brother , the king of <unk> . Roughly twenty years later <unk> <unk> was [MASK] by <unk> and was soundly [MASK] . B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was [MASK] by the king of <unk> but , instead of being [MASK] , he was re @-@ [MASK] on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and [MASK] <unk> in <unk> , forcing <unk> [MASK] Chaak , the then king of <unk> , to [MASK] abandon the city . The first two rulers of <unk> <unk> [MASK] to use the <unk> emblem glyph of <unk> , and they [MASK] felt that they had a [MASK] claim to the throne of <unk> itself .

He initiated a programme of new [MASK] and turned the [MASK] on <unk> when , in <unk> , he [MASK] the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully [MASK] . After this , <unk> never again erected a monument [MASK] a [MASK] victory . = = = = <unk> after <unk> = = = = By the 7th [MASK] , there was no active <unk> [MASK] at any Maya site and the [MASK] of <unk> had been razed by 700 . Even after this , formal war attire [MASK] on [MASK] was <unk> style . <unk> Chan K 'awiil I and his heir <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil continued [MASK] against <unk> and its allies and imposed firm [MASK] control over the area around <unk> , [MASK] as far as the [MASK] around Lake <unk> <unk> . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive [MASK] visible today . In 738 , <unk> , a [MASK] of <unk> , <unk> 's key ally in the south , [MASK] [MASK] to <unk> , defeated <unk> and gained its own [MASK] . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of <unk> to bring about the [MASK] of <unk> 's [MASK] allies . This upset the balance of power in the [MASK] Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the [MASK] of <unk> . In the 8th century , the rulers of <unk> [MASK] monuments from across the city and [MASK] them in front of the North [MASK] . By the late 8th century and early 9th century , [MASK] at <unk> slowed . <unk> [MASK] was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . = = = [MASK] Classic = = = By the 9th [MASK] , the crisis of the Classic Maya [MASK] was sweeping across the region , with [MASK] <unk> and city after city falling into silence . [MASK] endemic warfare in the Maya region caused <unk> 's supporting population to heavily [MASK] close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and [MASK] environmental decline . [MASK] continued at the beginning of the century , with the [MASK] of Temple 3 , the last of the city 's major [MASK] and the erection of [MASK] to mark the 19th K <unk> in <unk> . The [MASK] of the 10th <unk> <unk> in 830 passed <unk> , and marks the [MASK] of a 60 @-@ year hiatus , probably [MASK] from the collapse of central control in the city . During this hiatus , [MASK] sites [MASK] under <unk> 's control began to erect their own [MASK] featuring local rulers and using the <unk> emblem glyph , with <unk> [MASK] lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for [MASK] . In <unk> , <unk> K 'awiil is [MASK] on a stela at <unk> as [MASK] that city as the Divine Lord of <unk> but he is not recorded [MASK] and <unk> 's once great power was [MASK] more than a memory . The sites of <unk> and <unk> had by now [MASK] the once [MASK] <unk> emblem glyph . As <unk> and its [MASK] reached peak population , the area suffered <unk> , erosion and [MASK] loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . <unk> and its immediate [MASK] seem to have lost the majority of its [MASK] during the period from 830 to 950 and central [MASK] seems to have [MASK] rapidly . There is not much evidence from <unk> that the city was [MASK] affected by the endemic warfare that [MASK] parts of the Maya region during the [MASK] Classic , although an influx of refugees from the <unk> region may have [MASK] problems resulting from the already stretched [MASK] resources . In the latter half of the 9th [MASK] there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much [MASK] city of <unk> , as evidenced by a stela [MASK] in the Great Plaza by <unk> Chan K [MASK] II in <unk> . This was the last [MASK] erected at <unk> before the city finally fell into silence . The former [MASK] of <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , did not last much [MASK] , <unk> their final [MASK] in <unk> . By the end of the 9th century the vast [MASK] of <unk> 's [MASK] had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by [MASK] and simple <unk> dwellings were being erected in the city 's [MASK] <unk> . The squatters [MASK] some <unk> in the rooms they <unk> in the [MASK] structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of [MASK] refuse and non @-@ <unk> items such as musical [MASK] . These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual [MASK] far removed from those of the royal [MASK] that had erected them . Some [MASK] were <unk> and some were moved to new locations . Before its final [MASK] all respect for the old rulers had [MASK] , with the tombs of the North [MASK] being explored for <unk> and the easier to find tombs being [MASK] . After 950 , <unk> was all but deserted , although a remnant [MASK] may have survived in <unk> <unk> [MASK] among the ruins . Even these final [MASK] abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th [MASK] and the <unk> claimed the ruins for the next thousand years . Some of <unk> 's [MASK] may have [MASK] to the <unk> Lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a <unk> in [MASK] levels in the first half of the 9th [MASK] . The most likely cause of [MASK] at <unk> is <unk> and agrarian [MASK] . The fall of <unk> was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya [MASK] , the city having been at the [MASK] of courtly life , art and [MASK] for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . However , new research [MASK] <unk> <unk> from the <unk> reservoir system suggests that a [MASK] drought may have led to the [MASK] of <unk> . = = = Modern [MASK] = = = In <unk> , the Spanish <unk> Hernán Cortés passed within a few [MASK] of the ruins of <unk> but did not [MASK] them in his [MASK] .

As is often the case with huge [MASK] ruins , knowledge of the site was never [MASK] lost in the [MASK] . It seems that local people never <unk> about <unk> and they guided <unk> [MASK] to the ruins in the 1850s . Some second- or third @-@ hand [MASK] of <unk> [MASK] in print starting in the 17th century , [MASK] through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century ( Stephens and his [MASK] Frederick <unk> heard [MASK] of a lost city , with white [MASK] tops towering above the jungle , during their 1839 @-@ 40 [MASK] in the region ) .

In 1951 , a small [MASK] was built at the ruins , which [MASK] could only be reached by several days ' travel [MASK] the jungle on foot or mule . In 1956 the <unk> [MASK] began to map the city on a scale not [MASK] seen in the Maya area . From 1956 through 1970 , major [MASK] excavations were carried out by the University of [MASK] <unk> Project . They mapped much of the site and [MASK] and restored many of the structures .

The main <unk> were surfaced with stucco and laid at a [MASK] that <unk> rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs . The [MASK] area of <unk> covers an estimated 60 square [MASK] ( 23 sq mi ) , much of [MASK] has not yet been cleared , mapped , or [MASK] . A huge set of [MASK] discovered by Dennis E. <unk> and [MASK] <unk> in the 1960s rings <unk> with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide [MASK] behind a rampart .

Recently , a project exploring the defensive [MASK] has shown that the scale of the [MASK] is highly [MASK] and that in many places it is <unk> as a [MASK] feature . In addition , some parts of the <unk> were [MASK] into a canal system .

After AD 400 a row of tall [MASK] was added to the earlier Northern [MASK] , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , [MASK] hiding it from view . Eight temple [MASK] were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an [MASK] <unk> and a [MASK] flanked by masks of the gods . By the 9th [MASK] AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North [MASK] ; 18 of these monuments were carved with [MASK] texts and royal portraits .

It is close to the Maler [MASK] . = = = [MASK] = = = There are thousands of ancient [MASK] at <unk> and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of [MASK] work . The most [MASK] surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , [MASK] Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple [MASK] on their <unk> . Some of these [MASK] are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high . They were [MASK] <unk> during the early survey of the site .

As the [MASK] became more [MASK] , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . The [MASK] was [MASK] to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located in an area which was [MASK] for rapid [MASK] but was not forecast to intensify quickly . <unk> continued to intensify [MASK] the afternoon as the storm became more [MASK] . However , due to the [MASK] of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National [MASK] Center was [MASK] of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear [MASK] the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further [MASK] . The storm was also [MASK] into an area where shear was <unk> to [MASK] increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . Despite [MASK] being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm [MASK] slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as [MASK] activity to the south of the center became more organized . The [MASK] was [MASK] to be short in duration as the trough to the north was [MASK] , causing the wind shear to the west to become [MASK] . <unk> reached its peak [MASK] of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it [MASK] to become more organized . However , there were [MASK] that it had [MASK] begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming [MASK] and arc clouds began emanating from the [MASK] , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the [MASK] hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly [MASK] as strong wind [MASK] and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost [MASK] exposed and only a band of [MASK] persisted near the center . Despite [MASK] effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of [MASK] formed in the northern <unk> of <unk> . The [MASK] was found to have shifted towards the new [MASK] leading to an increase in [MASK] . The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as <unk> [MASK] westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was [MASK] . However , the [MASK] decreased once more and the low became [MASK] exposed by the late morning hours and <unk> weakened again . By the [MASK] , the center of <unk> was only a <unk> of clouds , devoid of [MASK] . During the [MASK] hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , [MASK] associated with <unk> began to <unk> [MASK] , mostly to the north of the [MASK] , due to the strong <unk> wind shear . By mid @-@ morning , <unk> re @-@ [MASK] slightly due to the [MASK] of some convection . However , the [MASK] was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on <unk> by late morning .

The [MASK] trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being [MASK] by strong <unk> shear . <unk> became almost fully devoid of any [MASK] by mid @-@ [MASK] and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely [MASK] on to [MASK] storm status . <unk> regained a small amount of [MASK] in the late night hours , but not enough to still be [MASK] a tropical storm . Due to the lack of [MASK] , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical [MASK] at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 [MASK] ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no [MASK] around the system , it would have normally been [MASK] a remnant low but , due to the [MASK] of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was [MASK] a tropical depression . The next morning , <unk> was [MASK] to a [MASK] low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No [MASK] was expected with <unk> as it began to move over [MASK] waters and remain under strong wind shear until it [MASK] . However , the remnant low [MASK] with <unk> began to show signs of [MASK] during the afternoon on September 7 . <unk> around the system increased [MASK] and the low was no longer exposed . On [MASK] 8 , wind shear took over the [MASK] again . <unk> around the [MASK] low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National [MASK] Center did not state the chance of [MASK] once the low became exposed . Finally , on [MASK] 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> [MASK] into an open wave . However , on [MASK] 10 , the remnants of <unk> [MASK] and global models picked up on the [MASK] system .

Further up the eastern side there is a [MASK] <unk> with a small <unk> .

The first recorded [MASK] of the peak was by <unk> <unk> in 1874 , who was [MASK] the mountain as part of the <unk> Survey . [MASK] measured as 14 @,@ <unk> feet ( 4 @,@ <unk> m ) in [MASK] , Mount <unk> 's [MASK] was later adjusted to 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) [MASK] a re @-@ [MASK] of mapped elevations , which sparked protests . The [MASK] change was made in 1988 as a result of the North [MASK] <unk> <unk> of 1988 ; it seems the original [MASK] resulted from the Sea Level <unk> of 1929 . A matter of some [MASK] arose after the Great [MASK] over the heights of <unk> and its neighbor , Mount Massive , which differ in [MASK] by [MASK] 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . This led to an [MASK] dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive [MASK] building large piles of [MASK] on the summit to boost its height , only to have the Mount <unk> [MASK] <unk> them . The effort was ultimately [MASK] and Mount <unk> has remained the highest peak in [MASK] .

The 4 @.@ 6 [MASK] ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) long North ( Main ) <unk> Trail [MASK] close to the <unk> Creek [MASK] , and gains about 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) .

The most [MASK] of the main routes is the Black Cloud [MASK] , a Class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours [MASK] on pace , gains 5 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) in [MASK] , and also [MASK] an ascent of the sub @-@ peak , [MASK] <unk> , at 14 @,@ 134 feet ( 4 @,@ 308 m ) . Even healthy and [MASK] <unk> report great [MASK] on this route , and despite the fact that [MASK] is a trail , the route is [MASK] steep , unstable , and rocky in places .

There are also routes approaching from the western face , and [MASK] ridge , from South <unk> Creek <unk> and Echo [MASK] <unk> [MASK] . Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the [MASK] routes require specialist <unk> skills or technical rock [MASK] . The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , [MASK] altitude sickness . This can [MASK] anyone , even those who are <unk> . In [MASK] cases , it can lead to high @-@ altitude [MASK] <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which can lead to [MASK] with breathing , <unk> , and death . <unk> are [MASK] to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and [MASK] before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon [MASK] while at high altitudes . Although the most [MASK] form of ascent is by hiking , Anna [MASK] Dickinson , the <unk> , [MASK] the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government . = [MASK] in Germany = The Church of [MASK] has been present in Germany since 1970 . German [MASK] estimate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active [MASK] in Germany today ; the Church of Scientology gives a [MASK] figure of around 12 @,@ 000 . The Church of [MASK] has encountered particular <unk> from the German press and [MASK] and occupies a precarious legal , social and [MASK] position in Germany . German courts have so far not resolved whether [MASK] should be accorded the legal status of a [MASK] or <unk> community , and different courts have reached [MASK] conclusions . The German domestic [MASK] service has monitored the organization 's activities . The German government does not recognize [MASK] as a religion . It views it as an abusive [MASK] <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues [MASK] goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German [MASK] . This stance has been [MASK] , most notably by the U.S. government , which recognizes [MASK] as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of [MASK] rights posed by sect <unk> . [MASK] in Germany face specific political and economic [MASK] . They are barred from membership in some major political parties , and [MASK] and other employers use so @-@ [MASK] " sect <unk> " to expose a [MASK] business partner 's or employee 's association with the [MASK] . German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning [MASK] in late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding [MASK] legal [MASK] . Despite this , polls suggest that most Germans favor banning [MASK] altogether . = = Background = = [MASK] , founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today [MASK] to be represented in 150 countries , has been a very [MASK] new [MASK] movement . Its stated <unk> aim is to " clear the [MASK] " , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their [MASK] [MASK] . Scientology teaches that the source of people 's <unk> lies in " <unk> " , [MASK] <unk> acquired in the course of painful [MASK] , which can be [MASK] through a type of <unk> called " <unk> " made available by the Church of [MASK] . The fact that [MASK] have to pay large fees for <unk> and other [MASK] services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history , with [MASK] <unk> it as a profit @-@ making [MASK] rather than as a religion . Critics maintain that [MASK] is " a business @-@ driven , <unk> <unk> , [MASK] ideology with world @-@ dominating [MASK] " , and that it tricks its members into parting with [MASK] sums of money for Scientology courses . [MASK] has fought <unk> lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal [MASK] as a religion . These efforts have been partly successful – [MASK] has gained [MASK] as a tax @-@ exempt religious group in a number of [MASK] , most notably in Australia in 1983 and the [MASK] States in 1993 , and in 2007 won an [MASK] case at the European Court of Human Rights , which <unk> Russia for failing to register [MASK] as a religion . The German [MASK] has said that it does not consider [MASK] a religion , but a " [MASK] enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable [MASK] and an extreme dislike of any criticism " whose " [MASK] structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany 's democratic society " . [MASK] , the German [MASK] has taken a very strong stance against the [MASK] . Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France , the Church of [MASK] was convicted of [MASK] fraud in October 2009 , after a court found that members had been [MASK] into paying large sums for [MASK] products , and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . Scientology is similarly [MASK] in Belgium , Greece and the UK . On the subject of [MASK] 's status as a religion , the German [MASK] has pointed to a 1995 [MASK] by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That court , noting Hubbard 's [MASK] that [MASK] should " make money , make more money – make other people [MASK] so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " [MASK] <unk> to be a ' [MASK] ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic [MASK] " . In the same decision , the court also found that [MASK] uses " <unk> and [MASK] practices " . Given the lessons of [MASK] 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be [MASK] by a fascist movement that started from similarly small [MASK] , Germany is very wary of any [MASK] movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . <unk> in [MASK] writings to the [MASK] of " parasites " and " <unk> " people who stand in the way of [MASK] towards [MASK] 's <unk> world " without <unk> , without criminals and without war " evoke [MASK] parallels with Nazism , and have led to [MASK] being classified as an " <unk> [MASK] movement " . To further justify its stance , the German [MASK] has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving [MASK] , including the conviction of 11 top [MASK] in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the [MASK] of U.S. government agencies , <unk> and the theft of [MASK] documents , a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that [MASK] practices took place in a " <unk> [MASK] " , and Scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through [MASK] court cases and private [MASK] . In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology [MASK] are " [MASK] so as to make the individual <unk> and [MASK] dependent on a Scientology system " , and that [MASK] often abandon contact with friends and family . = = History = = = = = [MASK] presence in Germany = = = [MASK] first became active in [MASK] in 1970 . By 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " [MASK] Churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " [MASK] <unk> " ) in Germany . The German [MASK] Churches are located in the big cities – Munich , [MASK] , Berlin , [MASK] , Frankfurt am Main , Hanover and <unk> . Of the [MASK] <unk> , nine are in Baden @-@ <unk> , and three in <unk> . [MASK] German re @-@ [MASK] , Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the [MASK] of the former German [MASK] Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden @-@ <unk> , <unk> and North @-@ Rhine <unk> . [MASK] is represented by a large number of independent [MASK] or <unk> in Germany ; their umbrella [MASK] is the Scientology <unk> <unk> <unk> Germany 's domestic [MASK] service , the <unk> für <unk> ( <unk> , or [MASK] Office for the Protection of the [MASK] ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 [MASK] in Germany , down from earlier [MASK] of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 . The Church of [MASK] reported around 30 @,@ 000 [MASK] from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years . However more recently [MASK] has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 [MASK] . <unk> in [MASK] membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in [MASK] its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or [MASK] in courses , regardless of their subsequent [MASK] . The number of <unk> bound [MASK] staff members working in German Scientology [MASK] is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . [MASK] formulated a " <unk> Germany " strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by [MASK] in other [MASK] and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of [MASK] German society in line with the <unk> ideal : a non @-@ <unk> [MASK] in which [MASK] enjoys <unk> influence . The programme sought to address [MASK] 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be [MASK] for political gain , such as Germany 's National [MASK] history , and to increase both [MASK] figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on <unk> [MASK] into key positions in industry and [MASK] . As most [MASK] seek to widen their influence in society , such a [MASK] could of course also be defended as a [MASK] effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , [MASK] to the <unk> , the strategy has not had any [MASK] success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being [MASK] and in 48 cases the [MASK] were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the [MASK] concerned had not used their positions to advertise [MASK] . According to [MASK] & <unk> ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " <unk> Germany " [MASK] is still being pursued . = = = Public [MASK] = = = German public discourse does not regard [MASK] as a religion , but [MASK] <unk> it as a [MASK] ( cult or sect ) , or as an <unk> profit @-@ making venture preying on [MASK] minds . Public concerns about the [MASK] dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when [MASK] debate took place about " youth [MASK] " such as the <unk> Church , <unk> , [MASK] of God , and the Divine Light Mission . The most [MASK] critics of these new religious movements were the " sect [MASK] " ( <unk> ) of Germany 's [MASK] Churches , who also actively promoted the [MASK] of private " initiatives of parents and concerned persons " . <unk> <unk> ( " [MASK] Information Campaign " ) became an important [MASK] dedicated to opposing [MASK] ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with [MASK] , filed successful lawsuits against the Church of [MASK] over its <unk> in public places , and published an [MASK] book , The <unk> of [MASK] and its Front <unk> . In 1981 , the [MASK] 's founder , <unk> <unk> , became the [MASK] of <unk> für <unk> und <unk> <unk> ( " [MASK] for <unk> and <unk> Freedom " ) , Germany 's most prominent anti @-@ cult [MASK] . <unk> from sect experts about the [MASK] of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the [MASK] to deal with the [MASK] ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the [MASK] resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public [MASK] giving general warnings about religious <unk> , the earliest of these [MASK] appearing in 1979 . <unk> by [MASK] such as the <unk> Siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides [MASK] with the Order of the Solar [MASK] , and the 1995 <unk> <unk> [MASK] in Japan , German fears and concerns about new [MASK] movements gained in intensity in the 1990s , with [MASK] attracting particular attention . <unk> that Scientology had a [MASK] character were reinforced when Robert <unk> Young , an American ex @-@ [MASK] and former PR official in the Church of [MASK] , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an [MASK] in Der <unk> , a widely @-@ read weekly magazine , describing [MASK] as a [MASK] system operating a <unk> – the <unk> Project Force – for members of [MASK] 's Sea Org found [MASK] of <unk> . From the mid @-@ 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on [MASK] appeared on an almost daily basis , [MASK] by books and [MASK] programmes that reached a mass audience . As noted by the religious scholar Hubert <unk> , [MASK] came to be seen as a " serious [MASK] danger that not only threatened to turn [MASK] into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic [MASK] of the state " . This view of [MASK] as a [MASK] enemy , <unk> adds , " became a matter of [MASK] <unk> " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against [MASK] , and being suspected of any [MASK] with it resulted in social <unk> . [MASK] A. Kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of German [MASK] shared the insistence that [MASK] should be suppressed . Scientology was viewed as " a [MASK] , business @-@ driven organization [ ... ] guilty of [MASK] human rights abuses . " Officials [MASK] primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the [MASK] was " <unk> to a [MASK] state " . Federal <unk> and state [MASK] were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of [MASK] . Government [MASK] on the dangers of <unk> increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a [MASK] number of them dealt with the Church of [MASK] . The German courts had approved such [MASK] in 1989 , seeing them as part of the government 's [MASK] to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not [MASK] with religious freedom . In 1996 , the German [MASK] launched an <unk> ( <unk> ) Commission to [MASK] <unk> and similar groups , in large part because of public [MASK] about [MASK] . Its final report , published in June 1998 , concluded that [MASK] , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by Germany 's domestic [MASK] services . An area of [MASK] concern in the German media has been the alleged " [MASK] " of businesses by [MASK] , in line with Scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in [MASK] for world [MASK] . Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most [MASK] among small and medium @-@ size companies , such as estate agents , management [MASK] and management @-@ training companies . Management @-@ consultancy firms led by [MASK] often conceal their [MASK] with Scientology ; once they have recruited members of their clients ' upper [MASK] , these managers may send employees to [MASK] trainers , as part of company education and training [MASK] , without informing them as to the origin of the [MASK] methods used . An expensive commercial version of [MASK] 's Oxford <unk> Analysis , usually offered free as part of [MASK] <unk> in public places , [MASK] entered some major German companies ( who were unaware of its <unk> ) via such a [MASK] @-@ [MASK] firm . In the mid @-@ 2000s , German sect experts expressed concerns that [MASK] were becoming active in the [MASK] after @-@ school <unk> market . These concerns arose because [MASK] of around 20 after @-@ school <unk> centres operated by [MASK] in Frankfurt , Hamburg , <unk> and [MASK] might be unaware that their children were being taught by [MASK] , using Scientology methods . <unk> [MASK] the <unk> services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of [MASK] , but not [MASK] itself . In early 2008 , Thomas <unk> , <unk> [MASK] of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and <unk> , and the [MASK] <unk> Knopp both likened the [MASK] Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels , the Nazi [MASK] minister . <unk> and Knopp cited a leaked [MASK] video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether [MASK] should " clean up " the world , the audience responding with [MASK] cheers – cheers which <unk> and Knopp felt were [MASK] of the audience 's [MASK] to Goebbels ' famous question , " Do you want [MASK] war ? " <unk> 's and Knopp 's [MASK] found few critics in Germany . Most Germans consider Scientology a <unk> [MASK] . In 1997 , Time reported that 70 % of Germans favoured banning [MASK] ; a poll [MASK] in September 2008 by Der <unk> found 67 % support for a ban . German [MASK] such as <unk> <unk> and Gerald <unk> have [MASK] that rhetoric dominates public discourse around [MASK] in Germany : in their view , efforts to " frame " [MASK] in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more [MASK] than the [MASK] <unk> . In <unk> 's words , this includes both the " efforts of German [MASK] to enhance their [MASK] with strong @-@ <unk> statements " and " [MASK] 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust [MASK] " ; commenting on foreign reporting on [MASK] in Germany , she adds that " the American press may prefer <unk> news to boring [MASK] and may frame the issue according to American [MASK] " . Both <unk> and <unk> assert that the situation is [MASK] by the general <unk> of scientific studies of [MASK] . <unk> as well as Irving <unk> , [MASK] of Religious Studies at the [MASK] of Calgary in Canada , have remarked in [MASK] on the lack of academic studies by German scholars . <unk> [MASK] this situation to the strong influence of the [MASK] churches in Germany , which has made German academics wary of [MASK] the subject , because they fear [MASK] for their research funding and for their prospects of future [MASK] if they involve themselves in the debate . In 2010 a German public [MASK] , <unk> , showed the film Until [MASK] Remains , a <unk> account of the effect [MASK] had on one German family . Said to be [MASK] on a true story , the film attracted [MASK] media attention and a viewership of 8 @.@ 69 [MASK] . = = Legal status = = While there have been calls for [MASK] to be banned , the Church of [MASK] remains legal in Germany and is [MASK] to operate there . Its precise legal status however is [MASK] . Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of [MASK] qualify as a " [MASK] or <unk> " ( Religion or <unk> ; these are equal [MASK] German law ) , and <unk> , whether or not these [MASK] are only used as a pretext for purely [MASK] activity ; if the [MASK] were the case , this would most likely imply that [MASK] would not qualify for protection as a " [MASK] or <unk> community " ( <unk> oder <unk> ) under Article 4 of the German [MASK] , which guarantees the freedom of belief , [MASK] and <unk> . Status as a " [MASK] or <unk> community " also affects a broad range of other issues in [MASK] , such as taxation and freedom of [MASK] . The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an [MASK] decision on the matter , but [MASK] assumed in 1980 that [MASK] represented a religious or <unk> community . The Upper [MASK] Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that [MASK] should be viewed as a <unk> community . In 1995 , the [MASK] Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of [MASK] merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or <unk> community entitled to [MASK] under Article 4 of the German [MASK] , although another [MASK] by the same court left the question open again in 2003 . In another 2003 decision , the [MASK] [MASK] of Baden @-@ <unk> in <unk> said there were no [MASK] that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for [MASK] activity . In 2005 , the Federal [MASK] Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4 @.@ 1 of the German [MASK] , which [MASK] the freedom of religion and <unk> <unk> . Many courts have declined to assess the [MASK] status of [MASK] , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . The Federal [MASK] Court for example ruled in 1997 that the [MASK] whether or not [MASK] was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business [MASK] . The German government does not consider the Church of [MASK] to be a [MASK] or <unk> community and asserts that [MASK] is a profit @-@ making enterprise , rather than a [MASK] . Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in [MASK] 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to [MASK] among politicians and the general public . = = Government [MASK] = = Given the [MASK] of Nazism 's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has [MASK] itself to taking active steps to [MASK] the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German [MASK] . The <unk> domestic [MASK] service ( <unk> für <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the [MASK] ) regards the aims of [MASK] as running counter to Germany 's free and [MASK] order , and has been monitoring [MASK] since 1997 , as have the <unk> for the Protection of the [MASK] in a number of German <unk> . Minister for Family Policy <unk> <unk> [MASK] the [MASK] , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose [MASK] with all the means at her disposal . The German Church of [MASK] has repeatedly challenged the legality of this [MASK] in court . In December 2001 , the [MASK] Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the [MASK] and ordered it to stop the [MASK] and deployment of staff and members of the Church of [MASK] Berlin as paid [MASK] . The court ruled that the use of <unk> was [MASK] . In 2003 , the same court ruled that it was [MASK] for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the [MASK] to include the activities of Scientology in its [MASK] , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the [MASK] . At the federal level , [MASK] lost a complaint against continued [MASK] by the <unk> in November 2004 . The federal court based its opinion on its [MASK] that the aims of [MASK] , as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings , were [MASK] with the German constitution . <unk> acting for the Federal Office for the [MASK] of the [MASK] pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be [MASK] to [MASK] , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government [MASK] in order to prevent anti @-@ [MASK] legislation . <unk> counsel acting for the Church of [MASK] had contended that Scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the [MASK] of the human being , and that Hubbard 's [MASK] were valid only within the Church of [MASK] and were subject to [MASK] , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these [MASK] in Germany . The court [MASK] and ruled that many sources , some of them not [MASK] to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of [MASK] did include the <unk> of the [MASK] of equality and other essential human rights . In <unk> , [MASK] was stopped by a court as [MASK] in 2005 , because there is no local branch of [MASK] and few members . As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of [MASK] in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent [MASK] of its activities by the <unk> after the North Rhine @-@ <unk> [MASK] [MASK] Court in <unk> refused to hear an appeal on the matter . Being suspected of [MASK] " ambitions against the free , democratic basic order " , the [MASK] [MASK] added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its <unk> . There is at least one [MASK] of [MASK] of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1998 , the Swiss [MASK] detained an agent of the German [MASK] , charging him with " [MASK] out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political [MASK] service and <unk> identity documents " . The German [MASK] posted bail for the agent . He was [MASK] given a 30 @-@ day suspended jail sentence for <unk> on [MASK] , and the German government apologized to [MASK] for the incident . = = " <unk> <unk> " = = A " sect [MASK] " , also known as a " protective [MASK] " ( <unk> ) , is a document that requires [MASK] business partners or employees to [MASK] any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or [MASK] contract . Such sect <unk> , [MASK] used to screen out [MASK] , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . " <unk> [MASK] 's " offices exist in Germany as part of [MASK] or local government . A work [MASK] introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the <unk> – local [MASK] agencies and social [MASK] offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned by [MASK] with the letter " S " . Where [MASK] are suspected of having [MASK] staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by [MASK] staff . Government officials have publicised the names of individual [MASK] and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some <unk> have placed [MASK] in the press saying they are not [MASK] in order to avoid the [MASK] stigma . Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by [MASK] , applicants for civil service positions in <unk> are [MASK] to declare whether or not they are [MASK] , and a similar policy has been instituted in <unk> . Companies <unk> for [MASK] contracts were likewise required to state they are not [MASK] ; in 2001 , this [MASK] was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that " the [MASK] of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in [MASK] the contract " . When it became known that [MASK] 's Windows 2000 [MASK] system included a disk <unk> developed by Executive Software [MASK] ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German [MASK] officials and clergy over data security and the [MASK] for espionage . To <unk> these concerns , [MASK] Germany agreed to provide a means to <unk> the utility . [MASK] letters of complaint about [MASK] from Scientology lawyers , some American companies such as General [MASK] , IBM and Ford Motor Company [MASK] their German <unk> to cease the use of protective [MASK] . The city @-@ state of Hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicated to opposing [MASK] , the [MASK] Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority , under the [MASK] of <unk> <unk> . In 2005 , in a case brought by a [MASK] , the Federal [MASK] Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease [MASK] the use of protective declarations to its business [MASK] , finding that the practice <unk> religious freedom . In June 2008 , the Hamburg [MASK] Court fined the city of [MASK] 5 @,@ 000 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 000 ) for not <unk> with court [MASK] banning the use of " sect <unk> .

[MASK] have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany ; [MASK] who were running such [MASK] had their permits revoked . In 1995 , a sports [MASK] and former member of the German national fencing team was [MASK] from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an [MASK] that he had [MASK] reading books by L.

On [MASK] 7 , 2007 , German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology [MASK] was continuing to pursue anti @-@ [MASK] goals , <unk> " essential basic and human rights like the [MASK] of man or the right to equal [MASK] " , and asked Germany 's domestic [MASK] agencies to collect and evaluate the information [MASK] for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the [MASK] . The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the [MASK] spectrum , with legal experts and [MASK] agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the [MASK] would likely fail in the courts . Sabine Weber , president of the Church of [MASK] in Berlin , called the [MASK] " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said that the German interior ministers ' [MASK] was based on " a few [MASK] out of 500 @,@ 000 pages of <unk> [MASK] " . She added , " I can also find [MASK] of quotes in the Bible that are [MASK] but that doesn 't mean I will demand the ban of [MASK] . " In November 2008 , the [MASK] abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or [MASK] activity . The report by the <unk> cited [MASK] gaps and noted [MASK] points that would make the success of any legal [MASK] to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the <unk> report stated there was no evidence that [MASK] could be viewed as a foreign [MASK] ; there were German [MASK] and missions , a German board , German <unk> , and no evidence that the [MASK] was " totally remote @-@ [MASK] " from the United States . A foreign [MASK] would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second [MASK] on which those proposing the ban had counted was [MASK] 's aggressive opposition to the [MASK] . Here , the report found that [MASK] 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology [MASK] sought to attack and overthrow Germany 's free and [MASK] basic order . " Neither its <unk> nor any other [MASK] " supported the " conclusion that the [MASK] had criminal aims " . The <unk> also considered [MASK] there were grounds to act against the Church of [MASK] on the basis that they were <unk> medicine without a licence , but [MASK] doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . [MASK] on the decision to drop the ban attempt , <unk> <unk> , Berlin 's [MASK] minister , said , " This [MASK] pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its [MASK] for [MASK] – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the [MASK] . But they put very little of this into practice . The [MASK] of the Government at the moment is that [ [MASK] ] is a <unk> [MASK] , but it is not an organization that we have to take a [MASK] to . " The Church of Scientology expressed [MASK] with the decision , [MASK] it as the " only one possible " . <unk> of Scientology 's activities by the German [MASK] services continues . In February 2009 , the Berlin [MASK] Court ruled that a poster placed by local city [MASK] on an [MASK] column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology [MASK] , warning <unk> @-@ by of the potential dangers [MASK] activities posed to democracy and [MASK] freedom , should be removed .

Richard Cohen for example , writing in the [MASK] Post , said in 1996 : " [MASK] might be one weird religion , but the German [MASK] to it is <unk> still – not to mention [MASK] . " Alan Cowell , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German [MASK] to [MASK] – motivated by officials ' fear that Scientology " was a [MASK] movement growing , like the Nazi party , from <unk> [MASK] " – was itself <unk> of " the Nazi era 's [MASK] " . The U.S. [MASK] of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany 's actions constitute government and societal [MASK] against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of [MASK] ' [MASK] rights posed by sect <unk> . The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of [MASK] in [MASK] in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of [MASK] and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , through which [MASK] gained the status of a tax @-@ exempt [MASK] in the United States . That decision also marked the [MASK] of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of [MASK] in Washington , using paid <unk> . The State [MASK] 's 1996 human rights report on Germany , [MASK] in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with [MASK] connections " may face boycotts and [MASK] , sometimes with government approval . " Past targets of such actions had included [MASK] actors Tom Cruise and John <unk> , as well as jazz [MASK] Chick <unk> . Also in [MASK] 1997 , an open letter to then @-@ [MASK] <unk> <unk> appeared , published as a newspaper [MASK] in the International Herald Tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " of [MASK] in Germany and Nazi [MASK] <unk> by Germany in the 1930s . The letter was [MASK] and paid for by [MASK] lawyer <unk> Fields , whose clients have included Tom [MASK] and John <unk> , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. [MASK] industry , including the top [MASK] of MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal and Sony Pictures [MASK] as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie <unk> , [MASK] Oliver Stone , writers [MASK] <unk> and <unk> Vidal and talk @-@ show host Larry King . It echoed similar [MASK] drawn by the Church of [MASK] itself , which until then had received <unk> notice , and was [MASK] by lobbying efforts of [MASK] celebrities in Washington . U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi [MASK] in the open letter as " <unk> " and distanced the U.S. [MASK] from Nazi [MASK] made by the Church of Scientology , saying , " We have [MASK] the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the [MASK] ' terror tactics against the German [MASK] . " Chancellor <unk> , [MASK] on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about [MASK] and don 't want to know . " German [MASK] [MASK] that " the whole fuss was <unk> up by the [MASK] to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a [MASK] . This is <unk> , pure and simple . " [MASK] explained that [MASK] because of Germany 's Nazi past , Germany took a [MASK] stance against all " radical cults and <unk> , [MASK] right @-@ wing Nazi groups " , and not just against [MASK] . <unk> 's Christian Democratic Union party [MASK] the letter as " absurd " and cited German court <unk> stating that [MASK] had primarily economic goals and could [MASK] be referred to using phrases such as a " <unk> <unk> of [MASK] " . In February 1997 , a United States [MASK] court judge granted <unk> to a German [MASK] who claimed she would be subject to religious [MASK] in her homeland . In April 1997 , John <unk> met [MASK] with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in [MASK] . <unk> later said [MASK] assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in [MASK] with [MASK] " . According to <unk> , Clinton recalled that " he had a [MASK] years ago who was a [MASK] and had really liked him , and respected his views on it " , stating that [MASK] " were given an unfair hand in [ [MASK] ] and that he wanted to fix it " . In [MASK] 1997 , John <unk> , Chick <unk> and fellow [MASK] Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and [MASK] in Europe ( <unk> , also known as the [MASK] [MASK] ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of [MASK] in Germany , and had a briefing with United States [MASK] Security <unk> Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be " the [MASK] 's Scientology point person " . The German [MASK] responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the German [MASK] had come to the conclusion that [MASK] 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize [MASK] ' mental and physical health and that it [MASK] its members " , adding that " membership can lead to [MASK] and physical dependency , to [MASK] ruin , and even to suicide . In addition , there are [MASK] that Scientology poses a threat to Germany 's basic political [MASK] . " A United Nations report in April 1998 raised concerns about the [MASK] of [MASK] rights posed by sect <unk> . However , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of [MASK] with that of Jews [MASK] the Nazi era . In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results of its [MASK] of the <unk> case . It asserted that several [MASK] letters which the woman had [MASK] as part of her <unk> [MASK] – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a [MASK] – had in fact been written by fellow [MASK] at her request and that of [MASK] 's Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal [MASK] trouble and about to go on trial for tax <unk> at the time she [MASK] for <unk> . On a 2000 visit to [MASK] , Florida , <unk> <unk> of the [MASK] Task Force for the Hamburg Interior [MASK] likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part of an " [MASK] effort " by [MASK] undertaken " for political gain " , and " a [MASK] abuse of the U.S. system " . German expatriate [MASK] resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused <unk> of <unk> a " hate [MASK] " in Germany that had " ruined the lives and [MASK] of scores of [MASK] " and maintained that Scientologists had not " [MASK] their plight for political gain in the United States . " Mark <unk> , a ( [MASK] ) top Church of [MASK] official , said that although Scientology had not [MASK] the case , " there would have been nothing [MASK] if it had . " In 2003 , [MASK] <unk> , writing in the Swiss <unk> <unk> Zeitung , noted that <unk> <unk> , a German Christian [MASK] , director of the Hannah <unk> [MASK] for Research into <unk> in Dresden and [MASK] of an honorary doctorate from Lund [MASK] , Sweden , for his <unk> of religious freedom , had been pressured to <unk> [MASK] of his scientific study of [MASK] after having found himself the subject of [MASK] criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards [MASK] . <unk> concluded that " <unk> " had " [MASK] " over science and noted an apparent lack of [MASK] in Germany 's ability to engage in open public [MASK] on the matter . The U.S. [MASK] of State 's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , [MASK] in 2013 , stated that " The status of the Church of [MASK] remains in <unk> .

The strictly amateur RFU [MASK] were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> , and were [MASK] to yield on the [MASK] of venue . The RFU was also in [MASK] with the other Home <unk> over the formation of the [MASK] Rugby Football Board ( <unk> ) . [MASK] a disputed try in an England – Scotland [MASK] match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the [MASK] of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU [MASK] that they would only join if they held a [MASK] vote , arguing that they [MASK] this as they were , they asserted , the [MASK] body , and had the most member clubs . Ireland , Wales and Scotland [MASK] refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following [MASK] , the RFU [MASK] and joined the <unk> .

The [MASK] try was followed by a final try for the English , who [MASK] won 7 – 0 . The RFU , at [MASK] 's [MASK] , promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> ' [MASK] of the day , Edward <unk> , who had led the team as Joe <unk> was [MASK] .

Hu was concerned that his essay would be [MASK] because he had not [MASK] it in the form of rhyming , equally @-@ footed [MASK] ( <unk> , <unk> ) used in the Imperial [MASK] , but his submission and the seal itself were [MASK] both accepted by the Southern Ming court . = = Ten <unk> [MASK] = = Despite his [MASK] as an artist and seal @-@ <unk> , Hu was primarily a publisher . His [MASK] house , the Ten <unk> Studio , produced [MASK] works on [MASK] , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on [MASK] and <unk> ; and copies of as well as [MASK] on the Confucian Classics . Unlike other publishers in the area , the Ten <unk> [MASK] did not publish works of [MASK] fiction such as plays or novels . This bias towards academia was likely a [MASK] of the studio 's [MASK] : the mountain on which Hu took up [MASK] was just to the north of the <unk> <unk> ( [MASK] Academy ) , which provided a captive market for [MASK] texts . Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten <unk> Studio [MASK] over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , [MASK] audience . The studio 's earliest [MASK] were medical textbooks , the [MASK] of which , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was [MASK] in 1631 and proved popular enough to be [MASK] ten years later . Hu 's [MASK] <unk> was a medical <unk> and [MASK] to have been the author of these books . During the <unk> the Ten <unk> Studio also [MASK] [MASK] works <unk> the rule of the Ming ; these [MASK] the Imperial Ming Record of <unk> ( Huang Ming <unk> Ji , <unk> ) , a [MASK] of loyal Ming [MASK] , and the <unk> of the Imperial Ming ( [MASK] Ming <unk> , <unk> ) , a list of [MASK] <unk> . After the fall of the Ming [MASK] , Hu renamed the studio the Hall <unk> in the Past ( [MASK] , <unk> ) as a sign of his [MASK] with the previous dynasty , although the Ten <unk> imprint [MASK] to be used . Despite Hu 's [MASK] from society after 1646 , the studio continued to [MASK] well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part <unk> on seal [MASK] catalogues showcasing Hu 's carving work . The Ming dynasty had seen [MASK] advancement in the process of colour [MASK] in China . At his studio , Hu <unk> [MASK] with various forms of <unk> printing , creating [MASK] for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> [MASK] designs . As a result , he was able to [MASK] some of China 's first printed [MASK] in colour , using a block printing technique known as " <unk> block [MASK] " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . This system made use of [MASK] blocks , each carved with a [MASK] part of the final image and each bearing a [MASK] colour . It was a lengthy , <unk> process , [MASK] thirty to fifty [MASK] printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and [MASK] to create a single image . Hu also employed a related form of [MASK] @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block [MASK] " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had [MASK] since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only [MASK] come into fashion again . He refined these block printing [MASK] by developing a [MASK] for <unk> some of the ink off the blocks before [MASK] ; this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> of shades which were not [MASK] possible . In some images , Hu employed a blind <unk> [MASK] ( known as " <unk> [MASK] " ( <unk> , <unk> ) or " <unk> [MASK] " ( <unk> , [MASK] ) , using an <unk> , <unk> block to stamp [MASK] onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for [MASK] on water or plants . This was a [MASK] new process , having been invented by Hu 's [MASK] Wu <unk> , who was also a <unk> @-@ based [MASK] . Wu had used this [MASK] for the first time in his book [MASK] Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , [MASK] in <unk> .

It consists of eight sections , covering [MASK] , bamboo , [MASK] , rocks , birds and animals , plums , [MASK] and fruit . Some of these sections had been released [MASK] as single volumes . As well as a [MASK] of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic <unk> , with [MASK] on correct brush position and [MASK] and several pictures designed for <unk> to copy . Although these [MASK] only appear in the [MASK] on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a <unk> and [MASK] approach to Chinese [MASK] . In this book , Hu used his [MASK] @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> of colour in the images , rather than obvious [MASK] or overlaps . The manual is bound in the " [MASK] binding " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , [MASK] whole @-@ <unk> [MASK] are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread .

Part of the wider <unk> [MASK] of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the [MASK] sector of <unk> [MASK] . Coming after the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll in which a strong Japanese [MASK] was defeated , the battle [MASK] in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elements of the [MASK] 15th Brigade [MASK] south along the <unk> Road . The initial phase saw the [MASK] advance towards the <unk> River . [MASK] the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese [MASK] at <unk> continued as they struck out [MASK] the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . This continued until [MASK] rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the [MASK] , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the [MASK] relied for supplies .

After an initial counter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been [MASK] by a garrison of US Army troops who began [MASK] their position around <unk> , [MASK] a strong perimeter . In March 1944 , the [MASK] launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy [MASK] . After this , the [MASK] on <unk> became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on [MASK] , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly [MASK] posture focused on [MASK] the perimeter around <unk> . In late 1944 , as part of plans to free US [MASK] up for the [MASK] campaign , the Australian II Corps — consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of [MASK] General Stanley <unk> — took over [MASK] for Allied operations on <unk> from the American XIV Corps . [MASK] forces began [MASK] on the island between November and December 1944 , initially [MASK] themselves around the US base at <unk> . Due to inaccurate [MASK] , <unk> mistakenly believed that the [MASK] forces on the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he [MASK] decided that the Australians would pursue an [MASK] campaign to clear the Japanese from <unk> in order to free their troops for [MASK] operations elsewhere , rather than [MASK] the defensive posture the US forces had adopted . However , Allied [MASK] of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly [MASK] and after the war it was found that the number of [MASK] on the [MASK] at this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 . The campaign that [MASK] planners developed entailed three [MASK] drives : in the north , it was planned that [MASK] forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> [MASK] and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the [MASK] control of the east – west avenues of [MASK] , as well as <unk> them [MASK] against further counter @-@ attacks , while also [MASK] the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main [MASK] in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were [MASK] around <unk> . = = = [MASK] moves = = = Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in [MASK] 1944 , the [MASK] 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive [MASK] <unk> .

Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily [MASK] by their defeat , [MASK] towards the <unk> River . The [MASK] 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with [MASK] the <unk> River , while the <unk> was also included as an " [MASK] [MASK] " . Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the [MASK] at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were [MASK] to be [MASK] opposing the 3rd Division .

In a change to the [MASK] that the [MASK] had previously employed prior to the fighting around <unk> 's Knoll , from early May they [MASK] on a two @-@ [MASK] front , instead of one . The 24th Infantry [MASK] was in the van , moving along the <unk> Road with the <unk> / 59th [MASK] its [MASK] and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) [MASK] inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , [MASK] on 3 May , advanced along the [MASK] Road from <unk> , after taking over from the 9th Infantry [MASK] . Moving forward under a <unk> [MASK] as they moved beyond <unk> , the 24th Infantry [MASK] was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese [MASK] around <unk> 's [MASK] on 17 April . <unk> by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th [MASK] Regiment , an [MASK] barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry [MASK] — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th [MASK] the position while another — ' A ' Company — carried out a flanking [MASK] to cut [MASK] track further north towards <unk> and <unk> .

By the time that the [MASK] had been taken in the [MASK] and the infantry had advanced to the line of [MASK] 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 [MASK] had been killed for the loss of seven [MASK] killed and 19 wounded . After this , the [MASK] continued their advance towards <unk> Creek , which was a [MASK] 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the [MASK] . In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined [MASK] over the course of the [MASK] week , although these were turned back . During this time , the [MASK] sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward [MASK] , one of which managed to slip through the [MASK] [MASK] positions either side of the <unk> Road and carried out a [MASK] of the <unk> River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) [MASK] of the main [MASK] .

With such strong support the Japanese offered little [MASK] and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry [MASK] covered almost a third of the [MASK] to the <unk> , for just one man wounded . Further [MASK] was made [MASK] the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they [MASK] a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a [MASK] gun , mines and other [MASK] explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to [MASK] carry out route clearance and proving [MASK] as the Japanese became [MASK] desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to [MASK] an artillery piece in order to lure the [MASK] tanks into a trap where they could be [MASK] by mines . The [MASK] began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To <unk> the [MASK] of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position [MASK] off the roads , forcing the [MASK] to fight without their armoured support . [MASK] , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with [MASK] accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant [MASK] and fire . Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th [MASK] [MASK] had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of [MASK] and suffered casualties due to their [MASK] in patrolling , which [MASK] in them being ambushed .

It was the [MASK] loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their [MASK] to defend the <unk> . After this , the [MASK] were able to resume their [MASK] to the river on 7 May without further [MASK] . The previous three weeks in which they had [MASK] 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been [MASK] for them , however , with the [MASK] 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 [MASK] .

As they waited for the [MASK] to resume , the Australians carried out [MASK] patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of [MASK] [MASK] during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Infantry [MASK] sent a company across the <unk> and [MASK] located a strong Japanese position on a [MASK] that became known as <unk> 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main [MASK] axis of advance . The main [MASK] was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry [MASK] on the right [MASK] to cut the <unk> Road and the [MASK] Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry [MASK] would divert the [MASK] of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry [MASK] which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the [MASK] line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , [MASK] straight up the <unk> Road .

After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a [MASK] field gun , they were forced to withdraw . [MASK] , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now [MASK] by No. 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , [MASK] along the length of the <unk> and [MASK] Roads . During this period , the New [MASK] flew 381 sorties , while [MASK] and mortars fired " thousands of rounds " . Two days [MASK] , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its [MASK] move on the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and [MASK] along the Commando Road with 32 <unk> and two [MASK] of [MASK] in support . Crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the <unk> , the centre [MASK] carried out an [MASK] along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to [MASK] the crossing .

The attack was resumed the [MASK] day , and the [MASK] were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were [MASK] from moving any further as the Japanese were still [MASK] in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol [MASK] 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . [MASK] , a company from the 24th Infantry [MASK] was able to move on to the high [MASK] on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be [MASK] mined and booby trapped . [MASK] and assault pioneers were called up to clear the [MASK] .

After [MASK] a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue <unk> with [MASK] along his head and spine and renamed [MASK] " Sonic Team " to match their [MASK] . Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was [MASK] by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru [MASK] . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel [MASK] that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which [MASK] in a tech demo created by the game 's [MASK] , <unk> <unk> . The game was well [MASK] by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of [MASK] . The game was also [MASK] successful , establishing the Genesis as a key [MASK] in the 16 @-@ bit era and [MASK] it to compete with Nintendo and their Super <unk> [MASK] .

Although [MASK] a robot frees the animal within , this is not [MASK] to [MASK] the game . The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , [MASK] into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or [MASK] , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles [MASK] released from <unk> ) . Sonic 's main [MASK] is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> [MASK] ( damaging enemies and some [MASK] ) . This can be [MASK] by jumping in the air or rolling on the [MASK] . <unk> around each level map are gold rings , and [MASK] 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life . <unk> are a layer of [MASK] [MASK] <unk> ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or [MASK] ) , he will [MASK] .

The game is [MASK] into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , [MASK] , Star Light , and [MASK] Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . A player must [MASK] through each zone ( [MASK] into three acts ) to progress . At the end of each zone 's [MASK] act , the player [MASK] Dr. <unk> ( who pilots a [MASK] vehicle each time ) in a boss fight . After the sixth zone , the player [MASK] directly to the Final Zone for a last [MASK] with <unk> .

A 21 [MASK] ( 16 kW ) <unk> & <unk> <unk> diesel engine had been [MASK] in 1981 and was fitted onto a [MASK] concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After [MASK] it was then [MASK] . Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as [MASK] . Off @-@ site , the new [MASK] wheel and <unk> were made . The [MASK] brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed [MASK] that it had been altered from the original one [MASK] in 1819 . The original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) [MASK] to allow the [MASK] sails to run at their <unk> speed . When the mill was [MASK] in 1832 it was [MASK] to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as [MASK] sails run at a slower speed than Common sails . The great spur wheel was [MASK] in [MASK] and the stone nuts reduced in diameter . The brake wheel was also [MASK] , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the [MASK] <unk> , [MASK] in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) in [MASK] . The opinion of [MASK] <unk> was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of the [MASK] brake wheel would be made , but [MASK] the cast iron teeth [MASK] . The remains of the original brake wheel were [MASK] as an exhibit in the mill . The original iron [MASK] were all broken , so a pattern was made and new [MASK] were cast in heat @-@ treated [MASK] cast iron . When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and [MASK] to the mill ready for [MASK] . The <unk> was made . Some of the small <unk> were [MASK] . The stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from [MASK] fir . Work at the mill over the winter [MASK] repairs to the [MASK] and windows , with only one window still needing [MASK] when the first work @-@ in began . New beech <unk> were [MASK] to the crown wheel , which was [MASK] to its correct position on the upright shaft . The [MASK] and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and [MASK] , a total of 41 people [MASK] over the two weeks . A [MASK] @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon [MASK] it was [MASK] to be unfit for use . Thus two new stocks were [MASK] instead of one . Modern steel stocks had already been [MASK] on cost and <unk> grounds , leaving two options . [MASK] stocks made from a [MASK] piece of timber , or <unk> stocks . Good [MASK] pitch pine was not <unk> in the lengths [MASK] . Douglas fir was <unk> in such lengths but was [MASK] on strength and <unk> grounds . A Douglas fir stock on a [MASK] mill had <unk> after only seven years . Thus it was [MASK] that <unk> stocks [MASK] be made . The 52 feet ( 15 @.@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from [MASK] fir . All timber had been [MASK] treated with <unk> and well <unk> . It was [MASK] that a <unk> stock would be up to 20 % [MASK] than a similar stock of solid [MASK] . The timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 [MASK] ( 38 mm ) thick and nine <unk> were [MASK] at the centre , where the stock passes [MASK] the poll end of the <unk> . <unk> attention was paid to where [MASK] joints occurred between [MASK] pieces of timber . Both stocks were made during the work @-@ in , with one of them [MASK] trimmed and [MASK] ready for use . The stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by [MASK] . The four sails were made . The [MASK] being slightly different pairs . Those on the inner stock [MASK] bays of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) [MASK] and those on the outer stock [MASK] bays of 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch . It was [MASK] that the new sails would be [MASK] , at the larger pitch . [MASK] 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 23 m ) long [MASK] were cut from a <unk> of pitch pine obtained from a [MASK] <unk> at Bury St <unk> . The <unk> are 6 [MASK] ( 150 mm ) square at [MASK] inner end . <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine , [MASK] for quality . The [MASK] for the sail bars were cut . That at the heel of the sail [MASK] at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , [MASK] by 1 ½ ° at each sail bar . [MASK] of the four sails had been [MASK] at the end of the work in . The <unk> and [MASK] <unk> was [MASK] to the mill . At the end of the [MASK] work @-@ in , the cap could be [MASK] by means of the hand <unk> . The <unk> itself , with the <unk> [MASK] red , white and blue was installed shortly [MASK] . The <unk> arm brake wheel was [MASK] around the <unk> . It was found that the <unk> was [MASK] on the upright shaft by ½ [MASK] ( 13 mm ) . When this was [MASK] the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 <unk> of an [MASK] ( less than 1 mm ) of true . The <unk> for the [MASK] were <unk> from a <unk> of pitch pine ready for [MASK] later in the year .

The four sails were [MASK] to the mill with the aid of a [MASK] crane at the end of the second work @-@ in . The stock , with one sail [MASK] was [MASK] inserted through the poll end of the <unk> and when <unk> in [MASK] and the <unk> had been [MASK] the second sail was fitted to the stock . The process was [MASK] for the second pair of sails . The mill [MASK] by wind again on the last day of the [MASK] work @-@ in . Work later in the year included the [MASK] of the fourth sail , [MASK] the <unk> and sorting out <unk> troubles with the [MASK] <unk> . The brake and brake lever were made and [MASK] and <unk> <unk> for the sails were cast . [MASK] work in 1984 cost £ 2 @,@ 918 .

Although this history is short when [MASK] to that of many other nations , [MASK] has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and [MASK] service have been [MASK] influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The [MASK] between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the [MASK] themes of [MASK] strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . As British <unk> , the Australian colonies [MASK] in Britain 's small wars of the 19th [MASK] , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an [MASK] nation , [MASK] fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in [MASK] , Malaya , Borneo and [MASK] during the Cold War . In the Post @-@ Vietnam era [MASK] forces have been involved in numerous [MASK] peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations and other agencies , [MASK] in the Sinai , [MASK] Gulf , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more [MASK] they have also fought as part of multi @-@ [MASK] forces in Iraq and [MASK] . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 [MASK] died during the course of these conflicts . = = War and [MASK] society = = For most of the last century [MASK] service has been one of the single greatest shared [MASK] of white Australian males , and although this is now changing due to the [MASK] of the [MASK] and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it [MASK] to influence [MASK] society to this day . War and military service have been defining [MASK] in Australian history , while a major part of the [MASK] identity has been built on an <unk> [MASK] of the Australian experience of war and of <unk> , known as the Anzac [MASK] . These ideals include notions of [MASK] , courage , [MASK] , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , [MASK] to popular thought , defined the behaviour of [MASK] soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War . The [MASK] campaign was one of the first [MASK] events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in [MASK] a sense of national identity . The [MASK] between war and [MASK] society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of [MASK] strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and [MASK] warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the [MASK] crisis of 1942 , while since then an [MASK] with the United States has <unk> its [MASK] . <unk> , this pattern of <unk> — both for [MASK] reasons such as shared values and [MASK] , as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that [MASK] strategic policy has often been defined by [MASK] with its allies . [MASK] , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with [MASK] often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> [MASK] until a crisis arises ; a trait which has [MASK] resulted in <unk> for major military [MASK] . Reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of [MASK] relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in [MASK] strategic [MASK] are also obvious . Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in [MASK] politics , the <unk> of notions of <unk> [MASK] , a belief in the enduring relevance and [MASK] of armed force as a <unk> of security , and the [MASK] that the status <unk> in [MASK] affairs should only be changed [MASK] . Likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been [MASK] themes . Change has been more evolutionary than [MASK] and these strategic <unk> have persisted [MASK] its history , being the product of [MASK] society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ Christian Anglo @-@ European heritage , as well its [MASK] values , beliefs and economic , [MASK] and religious ideology . These <unk> are also [MASK] of its unique security dilemma as a largely [MASK] island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the <unk> [MASK] of a middle power [MASK] removed from the centres of world power . To be sure , during [MASK] to the core [MASK] has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has [MASK] become involved in foreign wars . [MASK] these conflicts Australian soldiers — known [MASK] as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , for both their fighting [MASK] and their [MASK] qualities . = = Colonial era = = = = = British Forces in [MASK] , 1788 – 1870 = = = From 1788 until 1870 the [MASK] of the [MASK] colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces . Originally Marines protected the early [MASK] at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island , however they were [MASK] of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit [MASK] [MASK] for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps . The New South Wales Corps [MASK] was involved in putting down a [MASK] of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 . Soon however [MASK] in the corps [MASK] the War Office of the need for a more [MASK] garrison in New South Wales and Van <unk> 's Land . Chief of these [MASK] was the Rum [MASK] , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result , in [MASK] 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot arrived in [MASK] . By 1870 , 25 British infantry [MASK] had served in [MASK] , as had a small number of artillery and [MASK] units . Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the [MASK] against external attack , no actual threat ever <unk> . The [MASK] Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal [MASK] , combating <unk> , putting down convict [MASK] — as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress [MASK] [MASK] to the extension of European settlement . Notably British [MASK] were involved in the battle at the <unk> <unk> in 1854 on the [MASK] <unk> . Members of British [MASK] stationed in Australia also saw action in India , [MASK] , New Zealand and the Sudan . During the early years of [MASK] the naval defence of Australia was [MASK] by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies [MASK] , based in Sydney . However , in 1859 Australia was [MASK] as a separate squadron under the command of a <unk> , marking the first [MASK] that Royal Navy ships had been [MASK] stationed in Australia . The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in [MASK] waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and [MASK] handed over to the Royal [MASK] Navy ; the Royal Navy 's depots , dockyards and [MASK] were given to the [MASK] people . = = = Frontier warfare , 1788 – 1934 = = = The [MASK] of the native Aboriginal [MASK] to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were [MASK] hostile when the settler 's presence led to [MASK] over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous [MASK] ' lands . European diseases decimated Aboriginal [MASK] , and the occupation or [MASK] of lands and food resources sometimes led to [MASK] . By and large neither the British nor the <unk> [MASK] the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and [MASK] tribes rather than [MASK] warfare . At times , however , the frontier wars did see the [MASK] of British soldiers and later mounted police units . Not all [MASK] groups resisted white [MASK] on their lands , while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were [MASK] in attacks on other tribes . Fighting between <unk> and [MASK] was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained [MASK] . As a [MASK] , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent [MASK] and massacres across the continent . <unk> or [MASK] however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with [MASK] resistance beginning in the 18th century and [MASK] into the early 20th [MASK] . This warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful [MASK] in Australia . Faced with [MASK] resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of [MASK] massacres . Among the most famous is the Battle of <unk> in Western [MASK] in 1834 . Such incidents were not [MASK] sanctioned however , and after the <unk> Creek [MASK] in New South Wales in 1838 seven [MASK] were hanged for their part in the [MASK] . However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was fought [MASK] 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at [MASK] most of the island 's native [MASK] onto a number of isolated peninsulas . Although it began in failure for the British , it [MASK] resulted in [MASK] casualties amongst the native population . It may be [MASK] though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by [MASK] on <unk> . Although many more <unk> died than [MASK] , this may have had more to do with the [MASK] and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans . [MASK] tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-@ [MASK] hunting and fighting [MASK] — using <unk> , clubs and other primitive weapons . Unlike the [MASK] peoples of New Zealand and North [MASK] , on the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the [MASK] of the Europeans . Although there were some instances of [MASK] and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not [MASK] . The <unk> were never a serious military threat to European settlers , [MASK] of how much the [MASK] may have feared them . On [MASK] large groups of <unk> attacked the settlers in open terrain and a [MASK] battle ensued , during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their [MASK] . This could [MASK] be effective , with reports of them [MASK] in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their [MASK] , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their <unk> while the [MASK] <unk> . [MASK] , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the <unk> than the [MASK] . Central to the success of the [MASK] was the use of firearms . However , the [MASK] afforded by firearms have often been <unk> . Prior to the late 19th [MASK] , [MASK] were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock [MASK] . Such weapons [MASK] a low rate of fire , while [MASK] from a high rate of failure and were only [MASK] within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . These [MASK] may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , [MASK] them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs . Yet by 1850 [MASK] advances in firearms gave the [MASK] a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> [MASK] , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ [MASK] rifle and later the <unk> @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire [MASK] such as the [MASK] rifle , becoming available . These weapons , when used on open ground and [MASK] with the [MASK] mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> , often proved [MASK] . The Europeans also had to adapt their [MASK] to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies . Tactics [MASK] included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and [MASK] forces to drive the [MASK] off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while [MASK] from both banks . The conflict lasted for over 150 years and [MASK] the pattern of British [MASK] in Australia .

Four infantry [MASK] were [MASK] during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were [MASK] to the Middle East . The RAAF 's [MASK] were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the [MASK] air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( <unk> ) , [MASK] which almost 28 @,@ 000 [MASK] were trained during the war . The Australian military 's first major [MASK] of the war were against Italian forces in the [MASK] and North Africa .

The [MASK] of Australian units in the [MASK] returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the [MASK] of the Pacific War . The 9th [MASK] was the largest unit to remain in the [MASK] East , and played a key role in the First [MASK] of El <unk> during June and the Second Battle of El <unk> in October . The [MASK] returned to [MASK] in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and <unk> warships took part in the [MASK] Tunisia [MASK] and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war .

This strategy involved the [MASK] and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to [MASK] [MASK] in the region . To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were [MASK] in [MASK] during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan [MASK] . However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , [MASK] few Australian military units had been retained in [MASK] and the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Measures were taken to improve [MASK] 's [MASK] as war with Japan <unk> in 1941 , but these proved [MASK] . In December 1941 , the [MASK] Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was [MASK] in Malaya , and eight [MASK] trained and equipped divisions in Australia . The RAAF was [MASK] with 373 aircraft , most of which were [MASK] trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two [MASK] in Australian waters . The Australian military suffered a series of [MASK] during the early months of the Pacific War . The 8th Division and RAAF [MASK] in Malaya formed a part of the British [MASK] forces which were unable to stop a smaller [MASK] invasion force which landed on 7 December . The British [MASK] force withdrew to [MASK] at the end of January , but was forced to [MASK] on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island . Smaller [MASK] forces were also [MASK] and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in Ambon , Timor , and Java . The [MASK] town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the [MASK] on 19 [MASK] , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base . Over 22 @,@ 000 [MASK] were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh [MASK] in Japanese [MASK] . The prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and [MASK] beaten and killed by their guards . As a result , 8 @,@ 296 [MASK] [MASK] died in captivity . The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many [MASK] to fear that the Japanese would invade the [MASK] mainland . While elements of the [MASK] Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be [MASK] by the Japanese Imperial General [MASK] , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by [MASK] New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa , and New [MASK] .

The [MASK] mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese [MASK] operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and [MASK] to June 1943 . These [MASK] sought to cut the Allied supply lines between [MASK] and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were [MASK] . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern [MASK] which were being used to mount the North Western Area [MASK] against Japanese positions in the [MASK] East Indies ( <unk> ) . [MASK] 's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 . The [MASK] size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military [MASK] and labour shortages forced the [MASK] to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . [MASK] , the Government wanted the [MASK] military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively [MASK] campaigns .

In line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to [MASK] its ability to strike at enemy forces from [MASK] bases and to counter raids on [MASK] Australia . This was achieved by increasing the [MASK] of the <unk> and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern [MASK] . During this time the <unk> had no military units on [MASK] deployment outside [MASK] . However , in 1987 the <unk> made its first [MASK] deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several [MASK] and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in [MASK] to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état . While broadly [MASK] , this deployment [MASK] the need for the <unk> to improve its capability to [MASK] respond to <unk> events .

The reaction is [MASK] divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and [MASK] employed . It was [MASK] discovered by Ivan <unk> <unk> ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while [MASK] the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> . As [MASK] described , the <unk> <unk> involves the [MASK] of a <unk> <unk> using a [MASK] Lewis acid or <unk> acid promoter . The key step of the reaction [MASK] involves a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ring [MASK] which forms the <unk> product ( See <unk> below ) . As the [MASK] has been developed , variants involving [MASK] other than <unk> <unk> and <unk> other than Lewis acids have been [MASK] under the name <unk> <unk> [MASK] that they follow a similar <unk> [MASK] . The success of the <unk> <unk> as a tool in organic [MASK] stems from the utility and <unk> of <unk> as both motifs in natural products ( [MASK] [MASK] , the <unk> , and a <unk> of <unk> ) and as useful [MASK] <unk> for total synthesis . The reaction has been used in several total [MASK] and several reviews have been [MASK] . = = <unk> = = The [MASK] of the classical <unk> <unk> reaction was first demonstrated [MASK] by <unk> to be an <unk> <unk> and is [MASK] below . <unk> of the <unk> by the acid catalyst [MASK] a <unk> cation which undergoes a <unk> allowed <unk> <unk> <unk> as [MASK] by the Woodward @-@ Hoffman rules . This [MASK] an <unk> cation which undergoes an [MASK] reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen . [MASK] <unk> of the <unk> produces the <unk> product . As noted above , [MASK] that deviate from this [MASK] are known ; what <unk> a <unk> <unk> in [MASK] is the generation of the <unk> cation followed by <unk> ring [MASK] to an <unk> cation . In order to achieve this [MASK] , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans [MASK] , placing the vinyl groups in an [MASK] orientation . The <unk> of the system to enter this [MASK] dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ [MASK] substrates having an increased [MASK] of the <unk> <unk> due to <unk> strain . <unk> of an [MASK] <unk> α @-@ <unk> by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by [MASK] this [MASK] . Similarly , β @-@ substitution directed inward <unk> the s @-@ trans [MASK] so severely that E @-@ Z <unk> has been shown to occur in [MASK] of <unk> on a wide range of [MASK] , yielding the trans <unk> regardless of initial [MASK] . In this way , the <unk> <unk> is a rare [MASK] of a <unk> <unk> [MASK] , whereas most <unk> are <unk> . The [MASK] below uses <unk> hydride to trap the <unk> cation so that no [MASK] occurs . ( See [MASK] <unk> below ) Along this same vein , <unk> vinyl <unk> of the type studied [MASK] by Marcus <unk> of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate [MASK] due to the [MASK] of β @-@ <unk> , <unk> a large [MASK] of <unk> strain in the s @-@ <unk> <unk> . = = [MASK] <unk> <unk> = = Though <unk> [MASK] the general template above had been observed prior to <unk> 's [MASK] , it was his study of the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> that [MASK] the first major [MASK] of this process . <unk> correctly reasoned that the [MASK] <unk> <unk> in situ to form a <unk> <unk> before ring [MASK] to the <unk> product . The [MASK] shown below involves an <unk> <unk> reaction to generate the <unk> <unk> . Research involving the reaction was [MASK] quiet in [MASK] years , until in the mid @-@ 1980s when several [MASK] employing the <unk> <unk> were published . <unk> below are key steps in the [MASK] of <unk> and Nor @-@ <unk> , the [MASK] of which is [MASK] to proceed via an unusual <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> that [MASK] the <unk> <unk> . = = = <unk> = = = The [MASK] version of the <unk> <unk> suffers from several [MASK] which modern variants attempt to <unk> . The first two are not [MASK] from the mechanism alone , but are [MASK] of the barriers to <unk> ; the last three stem from [MASK] issues relating to elimination and <unk> of the [MASK] . Strong Lewis or <unk> acids are [MASK] required for the reaction ( e.g. [MASK] , <unk> , <unk> ) . These <unk> are not [MASK] with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope . Despite the <unk> [MASK] for catalysis , multiple [MASK] of the promoter are often required in order to effect the [MASK] . This limits the atom economy of the reaction . The [MASK] step is not <unk> ; if multiple β @-@ <unk> are available for [MASK] , various [MASK] are often observed as mixtures . This is highly [MASK] from an efficiency standpoint as <unk> separation is [MASK] required . <unk> destroys a potential <unk> , [MASK] the potential usefulness of the reaction . <unk> of the <unk> is [MASK] not <unk> , meaning that products can be formed as [MASK] of <unk> . = = Modern variants = = The [MASK] noted above limit the [MASK] of the <unk> <unk> reaction in its canonical form . However , [MASK] to the reaction focused on <unk> its issues [MASK] to be an active area of academic research . In [MASK] , the research has focused on a few key areas : [MASK] the reaction catalytic in the [MASK] , <unk> the reaction with more mild <unk> to improve [MASK] group tolerance , directing the <unk> of the [MASK] step , and improving the overall <unk> . These have been successful to varying degrees . [MASK] , [MASK] focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by [MASK] the <unk> cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the <unk> cation " [MASK] " in various ways . Furthermore , [MASK] variants of various kinds have been developed . The sheer volume of [MASK] on the subject prevents a [MASK] examination of this field ; key [MASK] are given below . = = = <unk> @-@ [MASK] <unk> = = = The earliest efforts to improve the [MASK] of the <unk> <unk> took advantage of the β @-@ [MASK] effect in order to direct the <unk> of the [MASK] step . This chemistry was developed most [MASK] by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of [MASK] , <unk> @-@ <unk> in the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes [MASK] amounts of iron <unk> to promote the [MASK] . With <unk> products , the <unk> <unk> was [MASK] for to varying degrees . The silicon @-@ directed <unk> <unk> reaction was [MASK] employed in the synthesis of the [MASK] product <unk> , shown below . The <unk> takes place before [MASK] of the <unk> alcohol <unk> , so that the [MASK] <unk> of the newly formed ring arises from [MASK] of the <unk> <unk> anti to the <unk> . = = = <unk> = = = [MASK] on the <unk> effects [MASK] over various trials of the reaction , Professor Alison Frontier of the [MASK] of Rochester [MASK] a paradigm for " polarized " <unk> <unk> in which electron <unk> and electron [MASK] groups are used to improve the overall [MASK] of the reaction . Creation of an [MASK] vinyl <unk> and vinyl <unk> in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper <unk> and <unk> [MASK] . In addition , the electron [MASK] group increases the <unk> of the α @-@ proton , allowing [MASK] formation of the [MASK] @-@ α @-@ <unk> via <unk> . It is often possible to achieve catalytic [MASK] using a <unk> or [MASK] group alone , although the efficiency of the [MASK] ( yield , reaction time , etc . ) is typically lower . = = = [MASK] cation generation = = = By extension , any <unk> cation [MASK] of its origin is capable of [MASK] a <unk> <unk> . There have been a large number of examples [MASK] where the <unk> cation is [MASK] at by a variety of <unk> . One such example [MASK] the silver <unk> <unk> ring [MASK] of <unk> <unk> <unk> . The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via [MASK] of <unk> silver chloride . In the total [MASK] of <unk> , <unk> of a vinyl <unk> <unk> likewise [MASK] a <unk> cation via ring opening of the [MASK] <unk> . = = = [MASK] <unk> = = = Once the <unk> has occurred , an <unk> cation is formed . As [MASK] extensively above , the typical course for this [MASK] is [MASK] followed by <unk> <unk> . However , these two steps can be [MASK] by various <unk> and <unk> , [MASK] . <unk> cation trapping has been developed extensively by <unk> G. West of the [MASK] of Alberta and his [MASK] covers the field . The <unk> cation can be [MASK] with <unk> and carbon <unk> and can also undergo <unk> <unk> with various <unk> [MASK] . <unk> below is a cascade reaction in which [MASK] cation trapping generates a <unk> core in one step with complete [MASK] . <unk> [MASK] with various <unk> is <unk> less common . In one study , the <unk> <unk> is [MASK] with a Michael reaction using an <unk> catalyst to initiate [MASK] <unk> [MASK] of the <unk> to β @-@ <unk> . In this tandem [MASK] the <unk> catalyst is required for both [MASK] : it acts as the Lewis acid in the [MASK] <unk> and in the next step the <unk> group of <unk> first [MASK] to <unk> in a ligand exchange with the <unk> <unk> oxygen atom before the actual [MASK] [MASK] takes place to the opposite face of the R @-@ group . = = = <unk> [MASK] = = = The development of an [MASK] <unk> <unk> is a desirable addition to the [MASK] of <unk> <unk> reactions . To that end , several [MASK] have been developed utilizing [MASK] <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> are also known , in which [MASK] <unk> direct the <unk> . Almost all of the [MASK] are based on the idea of <unk> ; [MASK] one direction for the vinyl groups to " [MASK] " in turn sets the <unk> as shown below . <unk> @-@ [MASK] <unk> <unk> can exhibit induced [MASK] in this way . In the example below , the <unk> @-@ group acts to [MASK] the <unk> by [MASK] the distant <unk> from rotating " towards " it via [MASK] <unk> interaction . In this way the silicon acts as a <unk> [MASK] . ( The starting material is not <unk> but the retention of [MASK] excess suggests that the [MASK] directs the <unk> . ) <unk> 's <unk> [MASK] can exhibit axial to <unk> <unk> transfer if <unk> <unk> are used . The example below [MASK] a [MASK] <unk> in 64 % yield and 95 % [MASK] excess . <unk> has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based [MASK] for <unk> <unk> that was employed in the first [MASK] synthesis of <unk> . The key step employs an [MASK] mixture of <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> and <unk> as solvent . The first <unk> Lewis acid [MASK] [MASK] <unk> <unk> was reported by <unk> Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) <unk> ligand [MASK] with up to 98 % ee . The [MASK] excess was unaffected by use of 50 <unk> % of the copper [MASK] but the yield was [MASK] decreased . = = Related Reactions = = <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are [MASK] also [MASK] under the same name . For example , an α @-@ β , γ @-@ [MASK] <unk> <unk> can undergo a similar <unk> <unk> <unk> that is [MASK] referred to as an <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> [MASK] . Other such [MASK] have been given similar names , including <unk> @-@ [MASK] <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . = = = <unk> @-@ <unk> [MASK] = = = Because they <unk> the <unk> cation , β @-@ [MASK] <unk> <unk> often [MASK] impede <unk> <unk> .
