Along with Li <unk> ( Li Po ) , he is [MASK] called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His [MASK] ambition was to serve his country as a [MASK] civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary [MASK] . His life , like the whole country , was [MASK] by the An <unk> [MASK] of <unk> , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . Although [MASK] he was little @-@ known to other [MASK] , his works came to be hugely [MASK] in both Chinese and [MASK] literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been [MASK] over the ages . He has been called the " Poet @-@ [MASK] " and the " Poet @-@ Sage " by [MASK] critics , while the range of his work has [MASK] him to be [MASK] to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace , <unk> , [MASK] , Milton , [MASK] , <unk> , <unk> , Hugo or <unk> " . = = Life = = [MASK] Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when [MASK] a work , a practice which Burton Watson [MASK] to " the close links that [MASK] Chinese thought posits between art and [MASK] " . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is [MASK] important . Another reason , [MASK] by the Chinese historian William <unk> , is that Chinese poems are [MASK] <unk> , <unk> context that might be [MASK] , but which an informed [MASK] could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The less [MASK] we know the time , the place and the [MASK] in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it [MASK] , and the [MASK] will be that we either <unk> the poem or fail to [MASK] it altogether " . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor [MASK] to Du Fu , [MASK] that the variety of the poet 's work required [MASK] of his whole life , rather than the " <unk> " <unk> used for more [MASK] poets . = = = [MASK] years = = = Most of what is [MASK] of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal [MASK] was Du <unk> , a noted [MASK] and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in [MASK] ; the exact [MASK] is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a [MASK] candidate ) . In later life , he [MASK] himself to belong to the [MASK] city of Chang 'an , [MASK] hometown of the Du family . Du Fu 's mother died [MASK] after he was born , and he was [MASK] raised by his aunt . He had an elder [MASK] , who died young . He also had three half [MASK] and one half sister , to whom he [MASK] refers in his poems , although he never mentions his [MASK] . The son of a minor scholar @-@ [MASK] , his youth was spent on the standard [MASK] of a future civil servant : study and <unk> of the Confucian classics of [MASK] , history and poetry . He later claimed to have [MASK] <unk> poems by his [MASK] teens , but these have been lost . In the early <unk> , he [MASK] in the <unk> / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , [MASK] a poetry [MASK] , is thought to date from the end of this [MASK] , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil [MASK] exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his [MASK] and that of [MASK] of later critics . <unk> concludes that he [MASK] failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou [MASK] his failure to <unk> [MASK] in the capital may have been to blame . After this [MASK] , he went back to [MASK] , this time around Shandong and Hebei . His [MASK] died around 740 . Du Fu would have been [MASK] to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank , but he is [MASK] to have given up the [MASK] in favour of one of his half [MASK] . He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area , [MASK] his duties in [MASK] affairs . In the autumn of <unk> , he met Li [MASK] ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a [MASK] . David Young describes this as " the most [MASK] formative element in Du Fu 's artistic [MASK] " because it gave him a living example of the [MASK] poet @-@ scholar life to which he was [MASK] after his failure in the civil service exam . The [MASK] was somewhat one @-@ sided , [MASK] . Du Fu was by some years the [MASK] , while Li <unk> was already a [MASK] star . We have twelve poems to or about Li <unk> from the [MASK] poet , but only one in the other [MASK] . They met again only once , in [MASK] . In 746 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to [MASK] his official career . He took the civil [MASK] exam a second time during the following year , but all the [MASK] were failed by the prime minister ( [MASK] in order to prevent the [MASK] of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the [MASK] , instead <unk> the emperor [MASK] in <unk> , 754 and probably again in <unk> . He [MASK] around <unk> , and by <unk> the couple had had five [MASK] — three sons and two [MASK] — but one of the sons died in infancy in [MASK] . From 754 he began to have lung [MASK] ( probably asthma ) , the first of a [MASK] of <unk> which <unk> him for the rest of his [MASK] . It was in that year that Du Fu was [MASK] to move his family due to the [MASK] of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region . In <unk> , he received an [MASK] as <unk> of the Right [MASK] 's office of the Crown Prince 's Palace . [MASK] this was a minor post , in [MASK] times it would have been at least the start of an [MASK] career . Even before he had begun work , however , the [MASK] was swept away by [MASK] . = = = War = = = The An <unk> [MASK] began in December <unk> , and was not [MASK] suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous [MASK] to Chinese society : the census of 754 [MASK] 52 @.@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census [MASK] just 16 @.@ 9 million , the [MASK] having been displaced or [MASK] . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life <unk> by wars , [MASK] <unk> and [MASK] <unk> . This period of <unk> was the making of Du Fu as a [MASK] : Even Shan Chou has [MASK] that , " What he saw around him — the lives of his family , [MASK] , and [MASK] – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various [MASK] — these became the [MASK] themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death of his [MASK] child , he turned to the [MASK] of others in his poetry instead of [MASK] upon his own <unk> . Du Fu [MASK] : <unk> on what I have lived through , if even I know such [MASK] , the [MASK] man must surely be <unk> by the winds . In <unk> , [MASK] <unk> was forced to flee the [MASK] and <unk> . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his [MASK] to a place of safety and [MASK] to join the court of the new [MASK] ( <unk> ) , but he was [MASK] by the rebels and taken to Chang 'an . In the autumn , his [MASK] son , Du <unk> ( Baby Bear ) , was born . [MASK] this time Du Fu is thought to have [MASK] malaria . He escaped from Chang 'an the [MASK] year , and was [MASK] <unk> when he rejoined the court in May <unk> . This post gave access to the [MASK] but was largely [MASK] . Du Fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use of it : he [MASK] trouble for himself by [MASK] the removal of his friend and [MASK] Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was [MASK] but was <unk> in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in [MASK] , but he soon [MASK] the court and on December 8 , <unk> , he [MASK] to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by [MASK] forces . However , his advice [MASK] to be <unk> , and in the summer of <unk> he was demoted to a post as [MASK] of [MASK] in <unk> . The position was not to his [MASK] : in one poem , he wrote : I am about to [MASK] <unk> in the office / [MASK] when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk . He moved on in the [MASK] of <unk> ; this has [MASK] been ascribed to famine , but <unk> believes that [MASK] is a more likely reason . He next spent [MASK] six weeks in <unk> ( now <unk> , Gansu [MASK] ) , where he wrote more than [MASK] poems . = = = <unk> = = = In [MASK] <unk> , he briefly stayed in <unk> ( modern Gansu ) . He [MASK] on December 24 for <unk> ( Sichuan [MASK] ) , where he was [MASK] by local <unk> and fellow poet <unk> Di . Du [MASK] based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years . By the [MASK] of that year he was in [MASK] trouble , and sent poems <unk> help to various [MASK] . He was relieved by Yan Wu , a friend and former [MASK] who was [MASK] governor general at <unk> . Despite his financial problems , this was one of the <unk> and most [MASK] [MASK] of his life . Many of Du 's poems from this period are peaceful [MASK] of his life at " [MASK] <unk> " . In 762 , he left the city to escape a [MASK] , but he returned in summer <unk> when he was [MASK] an advisor to Yan , who was involved in [MASK] against the <unk> [MASK] . = = = Last years = = = Luoyang , the region of his [MASK] , was recovered by [MASK] forces in the winter of 762 , and in the [MASK] of <unk> Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , [MASK] with the intention of making their way there . They [MASK] slowly , held up by his ill @-@ [MASK] ( by this time he was [MASK] from poor eyesight , <unk> and general old age in [MASK] to his previous <unk> ) . They [MASK] in <unk> ( in what is now <unk> , <unk> ) at the [MASK] to the Three <unk> for [MASK] two years from late spring <unk> . This period was Du Fu 's last great poetic [MASK] , and here he [MASK] 400 poems in his dense , late style . In [MASK] <unk> , Bo <unk> became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu [MASK] and employed him as his [MASK] secretary . In March <unk> , he began his [MASK] again and got as far as <unk> [MASK] , where he died in <unk> ( now <unk> ) in [MASK] or December 770 , in his <unk> year . He was [MASK] by his wife and two sons , who [MASK] in the area for some years at least . His last known [MASK] is a grandson who requested a grave [MASK] for the poet from Yuan [MASK] in <unk> . <unk> <unk> his life by [MASK] that , " He appeared to be a <unk> son , an [MASK] father , a generous brother , a [MASK] husband , a loyal friend , a <unk> official , and a [MASK] subject . " Below is an [MASK] of one of Du Fu 's later works , To My <unk> Friend <unk> ( [MASK] : [MASK] ) . Like many other poems in the Tang it [MASK] the theme of a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being [MASK] [MASK] to the provinces : = = Works = = [MASK] of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral [MASK] , and his technical [MASK] . = = = History = = = Since the Song [MASK] , critics have called Du Fu the " poet [MASK] " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The most directly [MASK] of his poems are those [MASK] on military tactics or the successes and failures of the [MASK] , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the [MASK] . <unk> , he wrote about the [MASK] of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the [MASK] people of China . As Watson notes , this is [MASK] " of a kind seldom found in the [MASK] compiled histories of the era " . Du Fu 's [MASK] comments are based on emotion rather than [MASK] : his <unk> have been [MASK] as , " Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are [MASK] to do " . Since his views were [MASK] to disagree with , his <unk> expressed <unk> enabled his [MASK] as the [MASK] figure of Chinese poetic history . = = = <unk> [MASK] = = = A second favourite [MASK] of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a [MASK] to the [MASK] sage , <unk> . One of the earliest [MASK] works , The Song of the <unk> ( from [MASK] 750 ) , gives voice to the <unk> of a <unk> soldier in the [MASK] army and a clear @-@ sighted [MASK] of suffering . These concerns are continuously [MASK] in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu [MASK] his life . Although Du Fu 's frequent references to his own [MASK] can give the [MASK] of an all @-@ consuming <unk> , Hawkes argues that his " famous [MASK] in fact includes [MASK] , viewed quite <unk> and almost as an <unk> " . He [MASK] " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by [MASK] it to " his own slightly comical [MASK] " . Du Fu 's compassion , for [MASK] and for others , was part of his general [MASK] of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had [MASK] been considered unsuitable for poetic [MASK] . Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu , " [MASK] in this world is poetry " , Du wrote [MASK] on subjects such as domestic life , [MASK] , paintings , animals , and other poems . = = = Technical [MASK] = = = Du Fu 's work is [MASK] above all for its range . Chinese critics [MASK] used the term <unk> ( <unk> " complete <unk> " ) , a [MASK] to <unk> ' [MASK] of <unk> . Yuan <unk> was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's [MASK] , writing in <unk> that his [MASK] , " united in his work traits which previous men had [MASK] only singly " . He [MASK] all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he " [MASK] made [MASK] advances or contributed outstanding examples " . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of [MASK] , from the [MASK] and <unk> to the <unk> and self @-@ [MASK] literary . This variety is <unk> even within individual works : Owen [MASK] the , " rapid stylistic and [MASK] shifts " in poems which enable the poet to [MASK] different <unk> of a situation , while Chou uses the term " [MASK] " as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for [MASK] written more on <unk> and [MASK] than any other writer of his time . He wrote [MASK] poems on painting [MASK] , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu 's seemingly negative [MASK] on the prized horse paintings of Han <unk> <unk> a [MASK] that has persisted to the [MASK] day . The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his [MASK] ( " <unk> @-@ like " [MASK] to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a [MASK] derivative , [MASK] style , but he came into his own in the years of the [MASK] . Owen comments on the " <unk> [MASK] " of the <unk> poems , which mirrors the desert [MASK] ; the works from his <unk> period are " light , often finely [MASK] " ; while the poems from the late <unk> [MASK] have a " density and power of vision " . [MASK] he wrote in all [MASK] forms , Du Fu is best [MASK] for his <unk> , a type of poem with strict [MASK] on form and content , for example : About two [MASK] of Du Fu 's 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally [MASK] to be its leading [MASK] . His best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add [MASK] content rather than as mere technical [MASK] . Hawkes comments that , " it is [MASK] that Tu Fu is able to use so [MASK] stylized a form in so natural a manner " . = = [MASK] = = According to the <unk> [MASK] , Du Fu 's writings are [MASK] by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it [MASK] " his dense , [MASK] language makes use of all the <unk> overtones of a [MASK] and of all the <unk> <unk> of the individual word , qualities that no [MASK] can ever reveal . " In his lifetime and [MASK] following his death , Du Fu was not greatly [MASK] . In part this can be [MASK] to his stylistic and formal [MASK] , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and [MASK] by Chinese critics . " There are few [MASK] references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these [MASK] him in terms of [MASK] , but not as a <unk> of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly [MASK] in [MASK] anthologies of poetry . However , as <unk> notes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose [MASK] grew with time " , and his [MASK] began to increase in [MASK] in the ninth century . Early positive [MASK] came from <unk> <unk> , who praised the moral [MASK] of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small [MASK] of the [MASK] ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece [MASK] Du Fu and Li <unk> on aesthetic [MASK] from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the [MASK] of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the [MASK] of the 10th century , <unk> <unk> [MASK] the first replica of his <unk> cottage in [MASK] . It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's [MASK] reached its peak . In this period a [MASK] re @-@ [MASK] of earlier poets took place , in which Wang [MASK] , Li <unk> and Du Fu came to be regarded as [MASK] respectively the Buddhist , <unk> and [MASK] strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the [MASK] of Neo @-@ <unk> ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic <unk> , occupied the [MASK] position . Su Shi famously [MASK] this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was " <unk> ... [MASK] ... [MASK] all his <unk> , he never for the space of a meal <unk> his [MASK] " . His influence was helped by his ability to [MASK] apparent opposites : political <unk> were attracted by his loyalty to the [MASK] order , while [MASK] radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary <unk> could look to his [MASK] mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his [MASK] . Since the [MASK] of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's [MASK] to the state and concern for the poor have been [MASK] as embryonic nationalism and [MASK] , and he has been praised for his use of simple , " people 's [MASK] " . Du Fu 's [MASK] grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his [MASK] as that of [MASK] in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be [MASK] by him . While there was never another Du Fu , [MASK] poets followed in the [MASK] of specific aspects of his work : <unk> <unk> 's [MASK] for the poor , Lu You 's [MASK] , and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> on the <unk> are a few [MASK] . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in [MASK] the <unk> from mere word play into " a [MASK] for serious poetic <unk> " set the stage for every [MASK] writer in the genre . In the 20th century , he was the [MASK] poet of Kenneth <unk> , who has [MASK] him as " the [MASK] non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language " , and [MASK] that , " he has made me a [MASK] man , as a moral agent and as a <unk> [MASK] " . = = = Influence on Japanese [MASK] = = = Du Fu 's poetry has made a [MASK] impact on Japanese [MASK] , especially on the literature from the <unk> period and on [MASK] and poets in the Edo period , [MASK] <unk> <unk> , the very greatest of all <unk> poets . Even in modern [MASK] , the term Saint of [MASK] ( <unk> , <unk> ) is mostly [MASK] with Du Fu . Until the 13th century , the Japanese [MASK] <unk> <unk> above all poets and there were few [MASK] to Du Fu , although his [MASK] can be seen in some <unk> ( " Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets " ) [MASK] such as <unk> <unk> in the 9th [MASK] . The first notable [MASK] <unk> of Du Fu 's poetry was <unk> [MASK] ( <unk> – <unk> ) , a <unk> <unk> [MASK] and one of the most prominent authors of the [MASK] of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a [MASK] on some poems of Du Fu from the [MASK] of a <unk> priest in Vol . 11 of <unk> . His student <unk> <unk> [MASK] many <unk> which were clearly stated " [MASK] by Du Fu " in their <unk> . <unk> 's [MASK] <unk> <unk> had close [MASK] with the Court and <unk> <unk> and <unk> Du Fu 's poetry in the [MASK] world ; one day <unk> <unk> , the <unk> [MASK] of the Court and the highest [MASK] of <unk> poetry , asked <unk> , " [MASK] I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li [MASK] ? " <unk> <unk> to reply , " Yes if you do have enough [MASK] . No if do not . " [MASK] then , there had been many <unk> on Du Fu 's [MASK] both in <unk> temples and in the [MASK] society , and as a [MASK] his poetry was often cited in Japanese [MASK] in the <unk> period , e.g. , <unk> , a [MASK] epic in the late 14th century , and some [MASK] plays such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . [MASK] the Kan <unk> era of the Edo [MASK] ( 1624 – 1643 ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) of the Ming [MASK] 's <unk> <unk> on Du Fu 's [MASK] ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) was imported into Japan , and it gained [MASK] [MASK] in Confucian scholars and <unk> ( <unk> ) class . The commentary [MASK] Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for [MASK] , <unk> <unk> , a notable [MASK] scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of [MASK] <unk> that <unk> [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in [MASK] and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary for its simplicity and [MASK] , while he criticized old [MASK] during the Yuan Dynasty were too <unk> . <unk> <unk> , the [MASK] <unk> poet , was also strongly [MASK] by Du Fu ; in <unk> no <unk> , his [MASK] , he cites the first two lines of A [MASK] View ( <unk> ) before a <unk> as its [MASK] and also many of his other <unk> have [MASK] wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka [MASK] a long [MASK] , a copy of Du Fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few [MASK] items which he was able to carry [MASK] . = = <unk> = = A [MASK] of styles have been used in efforts to [MASK] Du Fu 's work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The [MASK] Poems of Du Fu , " There are many [MASK] ways to approach the problems involved in [MASK] Du Fu , which is why we need as many different [MASK] as possible " ( <unk> <unk> ) . The [MASK] have had to contend with bringing out the formal [MASK] of the original without sounding <unk> to a Western ear ( [MASK] when [MASK] regulated verse , or <unk> ) , and <unk> the complex allusions contained [MASK] in the later works ( [MASK] writes that " his poems do not as a rule come through very well in [MASK] " — <unk> <unk> ) . One [MASK] on each issue is [MASK] by Kenneth <unk> 's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free [MASK] , which seek to conceal the <unk> through <unk> and expansion and [MASK] of the content ; his [MASK] to the allusions are firstly to <unk> most of these poems from his [MASK] , and <unk> to " translate out " the [MASK] in those works which he does select . Other [MASK] have placed much [MASK] weight on trying to convey a sense of the [MASK] forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three [MASK] Poets uses English @-@ style rhyme [MASK] , whereas Keith <unk> in Facing the Moon <unk> the [MASK] rhyme scheme ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and [MASK] some degree of <unk> . In The [MASK] Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the <unk> quite strictly , [MASK] the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . [MASK] , he deals with the [MASK] of the later works by combining literal [MASK] with extensive <unk> . In 2015 , Stephen Owen published [MASK] , with facing Chinese texts , of the [MASK] poetry of Du Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which [MASK] <unk> . = Kiss You ( One [MASK] song ) = " Kiss You " is a song [MASK] by English @-@ Irish boy band One [MASK] for their second studio album , [MASK] Me Home ( 2012 ) .

The <unk> 's fleet of [MASK] had proven highly [MASK] in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , which culminated in the [MASK] of the Russian Second and Third Pacific [MASK] at the Battle of <unk> .

To that end , he called for the [MASK] Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many [MASK] ships as the US Navy . This ratio , <unk> [MASK] , would enable the [MASK] Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in [MASK] waters in any eventual conflict . [MASK] , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the [MASK] of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 [MASK] tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern [MASK] cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ [MASK] t ) each .

To resolve this issue , the <unk> [MASK] a smaller 140 @-@ [MASK] ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its [MASK] shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the [MASK] armour of the [MASK] ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to [MASK] counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen [MASK] @-@ class battleships and Russian <unk> @-@ class [MASK] . For [MASK] reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was [MASK] slightly and the boiler rooms [MASK] to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 [MASK] 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 [MASK] ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) .

The [MASK] force , E Company , was still in its [MASK] reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> , [MASK] ready with the [MASK] platoon to move to the crossing site . [MASK] Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortar platoon to its [MASK] at the base of Hill <unk> where the <unk> [MASK] to set up their [MASK] . By 21 : 00 , the [MASK] front line unit was B Company on top of Hill [MASK] , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the river road which [MASK] around the hill 's southern base . The [MASK] <unk> , [MASK] Lewis B. Sheen , had gone forward in the [MASK] to B Company to hold services . On top of Hill [MASK] , <unk> Sheen and men in B [MASK] after dark heard <unk> in the water below them . They soon [MASK] a long line of North Korean [MASK] wading the river . The first North Korean [MASK] at the <unk> ferry caught the Heavy <unk> Platoon [MASK] in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H [MASK] men at the base of Hill [MASK] , <unk> miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the [MASK] site . The North Koreans killed or [MASK] many of the troops there . Hill was there , but [MASK] to the rear just before [MASK] , together with several others , when the division canceled [MASK] <unk> because of the attacks . The first heavy weapons [MASK] party was on its way up the hill when the North [MASK] attack [MASK] the men below .

From 21 : 30 until shortly after [MASK] the <unk> 9th Division crossed the <unk> at a number of places and [MASK] the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line [MASK] . Then , when the artillery barrage [MASK] lifted , the North Korean [MASK] were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the [MASK] sector and quickly spread [MASK] . At each crossing site the North Koreans would [MASK] local UN defenders before building <unk> bridges for their [MASK] and armor . At 02 : 00 , B Company was [MASK] . A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a [MASK] sounded , then came a [MASK] order , and North Korean [MASK] started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B [MASK] were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged [MASK] feature a 1 @.@ 5 [MASK] ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans ' [MASK] immediate objective . The North Koreans [MASK] were not aware of the Task [MASK] <unk> group lower down on the hill and it was not [MASK] during the night . But higher up on Hill <unk> the North [MASK] drove B Company from its position , [MASK] very heavy casualties on it . Sheen led one group of [MASK] back to friendly lines on 4 [MASK] . At 03 : 00 , 1 [MASK] , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only [MASK] , E Company to move west along the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road and take a [MASK] position at the pass [MASK] <unk> Hill and <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , 3 [MASK] ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the [MASK] and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from <unk> . This was the [MASK] terrain where so much heavy [MASK] had taken place in the first battle of the <unk> <unk> . [MASK] began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an [MASK] medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank [MASK] , knocked out a T @-@ 34 at <unk> , also [MASK] <unk> . E Company never reached its [MASK] position .

On August 1 , the 23rd [MASK] was in a new sector of which it had only a limited [MASK] . It took over a 16 @,@ 000 [MASK] ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) <unk> River front without its 3rd [MASK] which had been [MASK] to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L.

The 1st Battalion , under US [MASK] Colonel Claire E. <unk> , Jr . , <unk> the hills with [MASK] and squads . He placed the 2nd [MASK] in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st [MASK] and in a position where it [MASK] the road net in the [MASK] sector . On August <unk> the 2nd [MASK] moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th [MASK] sector . Two roads ran through the [MASK] sector from the <unk> River to <unk> . The main road bent [MASK] along the east bank of the river to <unk> @-@ <unk> and then turned [MASK] to <unk> . A northern [MASK] road curved around <unk> and lakes , the [MASK] of which was Lake U @-@ p <unk> , to <unk> . In [MASK] , the 1st [MASK] of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach [MASK] to <unk> .

B [MASK] lost heavily in this action . When word of the [MASK] that had <unk> 1st Battalion reached regimental [MASK] , Freeman obtained the release of G and F [MASK] from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st [MASK] and the latter on the [MASK] road toward <unk> @-@ <unk> and C Company .

The [MASK] was developed as a result of the [MASK] of wooden warships to explosive or [MASK] shells . The first ironclad [MASK] , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been [MASK] armored [MASK] since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an [MASK] <unk> in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started [MASK] two iron @-@ <unk> armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the [MASK] to move to an all @-@ [MASK] battle fleet . After the first clashes of [MASK] ( both with wooden ships and with one [MASK] ) took place in 1862 during the [MASK] Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had [MASK] the <unk> ship of the line as the most [MASK] warship afloat .

This change was pushed forward by the [MASK] of heavier naval guns ( the [MASK] of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea ) , more [MASK] steam engines , and advances in [MASK] which made steel [MASK] possible . The quick pace of change meant that many ships were [MASK] as soon as they were finished , and that naval [MASK] were in a state of flux . Many [MASK] were built to make use of the ram or the [MASK] , which a number of naval designers [MASK] the important weapons of naval combat .

Eight sister ships to [MASK] were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United [MASK] soon managed to take the lead in [MASK] . <unk> , France built ten new wooden steam [MASK] and converted 28 from [MASK] ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and [MASK] 41 . = = = <unk> [MASK] = = = The era of the [MASK] steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more [MASK] naval guns .

[MASK] made during the first half of 1854 proved highly [MASK] , and on 17 July 1854 , the French [MASK] to the British Government that a [MASK] had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be [MASK] . After tests in [MASK] 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , [MASK] the [MASK] Thames and <unk> Iron Works within the docks . The French floating [MASK] were deployed in 1855 as a [MASK] to the wooden steam battle fleet in the [MASK] War . The role of the battery was to assist <unk> mortar and gunboats bombarding shore [MASK] . The French used three of their ironclad [MASK] ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) in 1855 against the [MASK] at the [MASK] of <unk> on the Black Sea , where they were [MASK] against Russian shore defences . They would later be used again during the [MASK] war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating [MASK] <unk> and Meteor arrived too late to [MASK] to the action at <unk> . The [MASK] planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well @-@ [MASK] naval base at <unk> . The [MASK] have a claim to the title of the first [MASK] warships but they were capable of only 4 [MASK] ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they [MASK] under their own power at the [MASK] of <unk> , but had to be towed for long range transit . They were also [MASK] [MASK] to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad [MASK] convinced France to begin work on armored [MASK] for their <unk> . = = Early [MASK] ships and battles = = By the end of the 1850s it was clear that [MASK] was unable to match British [MASK] of steam warships , and to regain the strategic [MASK] a dramatic change was required . The result was the first ocean @-@ going [MASK] , the Gloire , begun in 1857 and [MASK] in 1859 . Gloire 's wooden hull was [MASK] on that of a steam ship of the line , [MASK] to one deck , <unk> in iron [MASK] 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . She was [MASK] by a steam engine , driving a single screw [MASK] for a [MASK] of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . She was armed with [MASK] @-@ six 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) [MASK] guns . France [MASK] to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more [MASK] ships to Gloire , and the only two @-@ <unk> [MASK] ironclads ever built , <unk> and [MASK] . The Royal Navy had not been keen to [MASK] its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was [MASK] that the first British ironclad would <unk> the French ships in every respect , [MASK] speed . A fast ship would have the [MASK] of being able to choose a range of [MASK] which could make her <unk> to enemy fire . The British [MASK] was more a large , [MASK] frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line . The [MASK] for speed meant a very long [MASK] , which had to be built from iron . The result was the [MASK] of two Warrior @-@ class [MASK] ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a [MASK] design , though there were [MASK] compromises between ' sea @-@ keeping ' , strategic range and armour [MASK] ; their weapons were more [MASK] than that of Gloire , and with the [MASK] set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they [MASK] steam at 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ) . Yet the [MASK] and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour [MASK] along the [MASK] and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince ( but also the smaller Defence and [MASK] ) were obliged to [MASK] their armour in a central ' citadel ' or ' [MASK] box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft [MASK] of the vessel [MASK] . The use of iron in the [MASK] of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and [MASK] repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more [MASK] to <unk> by marine life . By 1862 , navies across Europe had [MASK] [MASK] . Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under [MASK] , though the British vessels were larger . [MASK] , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building [MASK] . However , the first battles using the new [MASK] ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships markedly [MASK] from the broadside @-@ firing , <unk> [MASK] of Gloire and Warrior . The use of [MASK] by both sides in the American Civil War , and the clash of the Italian and [MASK] fleets at the Battle of <unk> , had an [MASK] influence on the [MASK] of ironclad design . = = = First battles between [MASK] : the U.S. Civil War = = = The first use of [MASK] in action came in the U.S. [MASK] War . The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no [MASK] , its most [MASK] ships being six steam @-@ powered <unk> [MASK] . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the [MASK] sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by [MASK] modern armored ships . In May 1861 , the [MASK] Congress voted that $ 2 million be [MASK] for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the [MASK] started work on [MASK] and converting wooden ships . On 12 [MASK] 1861 , the CSS <unk> became the first [MASK] to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the [MASK] during the Battle of the Head of <unk> . She had been converted from a [MASK] vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal [MASK] . In February 1862 , the larger CSS Virginia joined the [MASK] Navy , having been [MASK] at Norfolk . <unk> on the hull of USS <unk> , Virginia [MASK] was a [MASK] warship made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered [MASK] ironclad <unk> , when she entered the [MASK] navy . By this time , the Union had [MASK] seven ironclad gunboats of the City class , and was about to [MASK] the USS <unk> , an [MASK] design proposed by the Swedish inventor John [MASK] . The Union was also building a large armored [MASK] , the USS New <unk> , and the smaller USS <unk> . The first battle between [MASK] happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored <unk> was [MASK] to protect the Union 's wooden fleet from the [MASK] ram Virginia and other [MASK] warships . In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of [MASK] Roads , the two ironclads [MASK] tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . The battle [MASK] [MASK] worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads [MASK] them easily . The Civil War saw more [MASK] built by both sides , and they played an [MASK] role in the naval war [MASK] the <unk> warships , commerce raiders and [MASK] runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty [MASK] modeled on their namesake . The [MASK] built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their [MASK] to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations [MASK] ships being built for the [MASK] — especially in Russia , the only [MASK] to openly support the Union through the war . Only CSS <unk> was [MASK] , and she arrived in [MASK] waters just in time for the end of the war . Through the [MASK] of the war , [MASK] saw action in the Union 's attacks on [MASK] ports . Seven Union monitors , including USS <unk> , as well as two other [MASK] , the [MASK] frigate New <unk> and a light @-@ draft USS <unk> , [MASK] in the failed attack on Charleston ; one was sunk . Two small [MASK] , CSS <unk> State and CSS <unk> [MASK] in the defence of the [MASK] . For the later attack at Mobile Bay , the Union [MASK] four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS Tennessee , the [MASK] 's most [MASK] ironclad and the gunboats CSS Morgan , CSS Gaines , CSS Selma . On the [MASK] front , the Union built a [MASK] force of river ironclads , beginning with several converted <unk> and then [MASK] engineer James <unk> of St. Louis , [MASK] to build the City @-@ class [MASK] . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central <unk> wheel , all [MASK] by an [MASK] <unk> . They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller [MASK] , and were very well suited for river [MASK] . <unk> also [MASK] monitors for use on the rivers , the first two of which [MASK] from the ocean @-@ going monitors in that they [MASK] a <unk> wheel ( the USS <unk> and USS Osage ) . <unk> <unk> [MASK] were some of the better [MASK] of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other [MASK] that served <unk> with the fleet . All were of [MASK] design , some more [MASK] than others , and some were similar to [MASK] <unk> but with armored side @-@ mounted <unk> wheels . All were armed with various [MASK] and some rifled guns . If nothing else the [MASK] of the American Civil War and its wild variety of [MASK] ironclad designs , some more [MASK] ( or disastrous ) than others , [MASK] the emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required in applying the latest [MASK] advances in iron armour manufacture , ship [MASK] and gun design — to name a few — also going on in [MASK] . There was no such thing as a ' [MASK] ' ironclad which could be <unk> in every possible [MASK] ; ship duels , [MASK] up to forts , Brown & Blue @-@ water [MASK] . The Union ironclads played an important role in the [MASK] and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts , [MASK] and vessels with relative <unk> to enemy fire . They were not as [MASK] armored as the ocean @-@ going [MASK] of the Union , but they were [MASK] for their intended use . More Western Flotilla Union [MASK] were sunk by torpedoes ( [MASK] ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore [MASK] , not [MASK] vessels . = = = <unk> : First fleet [MASK] = = = The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , [MASK] ironclad warships was the Battle of <unk> in 1866 . <unk> [MASK] the [MASK] and Italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden [MASK] and <unk> and ironclad warships on both sides in the [MASK] naval battle between the battles of <unk> and <unk> . The Italian fleet [MASK] of 12 [MASK] and a similar number of wooden warships , escorting [MASK] which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of <unk> . Among the Italian [MASK] were seven [MASK] ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built <unk> — a [MASK] @-@ <unk> ram . <unk> them , the [MASK] navy had seven ironclad frigates . The [MASK] believed their ships to have less [MASK] guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the [MASK] at close range and ram them . The Austrian fleet formed into an <unk> [MASK] with the ironclads in the first line , [MASK] at the Italian ironclad [MASK] . In the <unk> which followed both sides were [MASK] by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of <unk> — [MASK] , the [MASK] <unk> attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian [MASK] great attention in following years . The superior Italian fleet lost its two [MASK] , Re d 'Italia and [MASK] , while the Austrian <unk> screw two @-@ <unk> SMS Kaiser [MASK] survived close actions with four Italian ironclads . The battle ensured the [MASK] of the ram as a weapon in European [MASK] for many years , and the victory won by Austria [MASK] it as the [MASK] naval power in the Adriatic . The battles of the [MASK] Civil War and at <unk> were very [MASK] on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed . In [MASK] , it taught a generation of naval officers the [MASK] lesson that <unk> was the best way to sink enemy [MASK] . = = Armament and tactics = = The [MASK] of iron armor meant that the [MASK] naval armament of dozens of light cannon became [MASK] , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . To penetrate armor , [MASK] heavy guns were mounted on ships ; [MASK] , the view that <unk> was the only way to sink an [MASK] became [MASK] . The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a [MASK] away from the ships mounting many guns [MASK] , in the manner of a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , [MASK] a handful of guns in [MASK] for all @-@ round fire . = = = Ram [MASK] = = = From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the [MASK] of the [MASK] meant that the ram was again the most [MASK] weapon in naval warfare . With steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor [MASK] them <unk> to <unk> , the ram seemed to offer the [MASK] to strike a decisive blow . The <unk> damage [MASK] by the guns of <unk> and [MASK] at Battle of Hampton Roads and the [MASK] but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS [MASK] Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d 'Italia at <unk> gave [MASK] to the <unk> craze . From the early 1870s to early 1880s most [MASK] naval [MASK] thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval [MASK] by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had [MASK] been sunk by <unk> [MASK] to be heard . The revival of <unk> had a [MASK] effect on naval tactics . Since the 17th century the [MASK] tactic of naval [MASK] had been the line of battle , where a fleet [MASK] a long line to give it the best fire from its [MASK] guns . This tactic was totally [MASK] to <unk> , and the ram threw fleet tactics into <unk> . The [MASK] of how an ironclad fleet [MASK] deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never [MASK] in battle , and if it had been , [MASK] might have shown that rams could only be used [MASK] ships which were already stopped dead in the water . The ram [MASK] fell out of [MASK] in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less [MASK] to quick @-@ firing guns . = = = [MASK] of naval guns = = = The armament of [MASK] tended to become [MASK] in a small number of powerful guns capable of [MASK] the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns [MASK] markedly to achieve greater [MASK] . Throughout the ironclad era navies also <unk> with the <unk> of rifled versus [MASK] guns and breech @-@ [MASK] versus muzzle @-@ loading . HMS Warrior carried a [MASK] of 110 @-@ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @-@ loading rifles and more [MASK] 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore guns . Warrior [MASK] the challenges of picking the right [MASK] ; the breech @-@ <unk> she carried , designed by Sir William [MASK] , were intended to be the next [MASK] of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly [MASK] from service . <unk> @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important [MASK] . A breech @-@ <unk> could be <unk> [MASK] moving the gun , a lengthy process [MASK] if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed . The [MASK] 's [MASK] guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an [MASK] smoothbore and , because of their <unk> , more accurate . [MASK] , the design was rejected because of [MASK] which plagued breech @-@ <unk> for decades . The [MASK] of the breech @-@ <unk> was the obvious [MASK] of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive [MASK] of gunpowder into gas . This [MASK] <unk> the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also <unk> great [MASK] on the gun @-@ [MASK] . If the breech — which [MASK] some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not [MASK] secure , then there is a risk that either gas will [MASK] through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn [MASK] the muzzle [MASK] of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's [MASK] guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to [MASK] the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) [MASK] of Gloire , while [MASK] the screw which closed the breech flew [MASK] out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were [MASK] with the breech @-@ loading guns which became [MASK] in the French and German navies . These problems [MASK] the British to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons of [MASK] power until the 1880s . After a brief [MASK] of 100 @-@ pounder or 9 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 240 mm ) [MASK] Somerset Gun , which [MASK] 6 @.@ 5 tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) , the Admiralty [MASK] 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , [MASK] 7 tons . These were followed by a series of [MASK] <unk> weapons — guns [MASK] 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre [MASK] from 8 @-@ [MASK] ( 203 mm ) to 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) . The [MASK] to retain muzzle @-@ <unk> until the 1880s has been [MASK] by [MASK] . However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle @-@ <unk> had superior [MASK] in [MASK] of both range and rate of fire than the French and [MASK] breech @-@ <unk> , which suffered from the same problems as had the first [MASK] guns . From 1875 [MASK] , the balance between <unk> and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de <unk> [MASK] a method of [MASK] sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as <unk> , the [MASK] size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more [MASK] . With guns of such size there was no [MASK] of <unk> in the gun for re @-@ [MASK] , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and [MASK] [MASK] systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without [MASK] the crew to enemy fire . In [MASK] , the 81 @-@ ton , 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns of HMS [MASK] fired only once every 11 minutes while [MASK] Alexandria during the [MASK] <unk> . The 100 @-@ ton , 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns of [MASK] <unk> could each fire a round every 15 [MASK] . In the Royal Navy , the [MASK] to breech @-@ <unk> was [MASK] made in 1879 ; as well as the [MASK] advantages in terms of performance , opinion was <unk> by an [MASK] on board HMS <unk> caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded , a [MASK] which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ [MASK] gun . The calibre and weight of guns could only [MASK] so far . The [MASK] the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the [MASK] on the ship 's hull , and the less the [MASK] of the ship . The size of the gun [MASK] in the 1880s , with some of the [MASK] <unk> of gun ever used at sea . HMS <unk> [MASK] two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( [MASK] mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each [MASK] 110 tons — no British [MASK] would ever carry guns as large . The [MASK] 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be [MASK] than any gun fitted to a [MASK] until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) [MASK] of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One [MASK] which became more acute was that even from the original [MASK] models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far [MASK] simple accuracy , [MASK] at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' [MASK] weapons @-@ platform ' could <unk> the [MASK] of <unk> . American ordnance experts [MASK] preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' <unk> ' along the [MASK] of the water . <unk> [MASK] combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were [MASK] to those in the Age of <unk> — [MASK] a vessel could now be [MASK] to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the [MASK] chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval [MASK] in the ' Age of the <unk> ' were still [MASK] at ranges within easy [MASK] of their targets , and well below the [MASK] reach of their ships ' guns . Another method of [MASK] firepower was to vary the <unk> fired or the nature of the [MASK] . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after [MASK] ; this meant cannons had [MASK] short barrels , to [MASK] the barrel itself slowing the shell . The <unk> of the black powder [MASK] also meant that guns were [MASK] to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into <unk> , [MASK] a slower , more [MASK] explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the [MASK] of chemically different brown powder which <unk> more [MASK] again . It also put less stress on the <unk> of the barrel , [MASK] guns to last longer and to be [MASK] to <unk> <unk> . The [MASK] of <unk> powder , based on <unk> or <unk> , by the French [MASK] Paul <unk> in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of [MASK] with longer [MASK] . The guns of the pre @-@ <unk> [MASK] of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre [MASK] to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but [MASK] grew in length of barrel , making use of [MASK] <unk> to gain greater muzzle [MASK] . The nature of the [MASK] also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armor @-@ [MASK] <unk> was a solid cast @-@ iron shot . [MASK] , shot of <unk> iron , a [MASK] iron alloy , gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities . [MASK] the armor @-@ piercing shell was [MASK] . = = = <unk> of armament = = = = = = = <unk> [MASK] = = = = The first British , French and Russian [MASK] , in a logical [MASK] of warship design from the long [MASK] era of wooden ships of the line , [MASK] their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called " [MASK] ironclads . " Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were [MASK] of this type . [MASK] their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a [MASK] row of guns along the main deck on each side [MASK] than a row on each deck . A [MASK] number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , [MASK] in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers [MASK] Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The [MASK] of mounting guns on both [MASK] was that the ship could [MASK] more than one <unk> at a time , and the [MASK] did not impede the field of fire . <unk> armament also had [MASK] , which became more serious as ironclad [MASK] developed . <unk> guns to penetrate ever @-@ [MASK] armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . [MASK] , the adoption of <unk> as an important [MASK] meant the need for ahead and all @-@ round fire . These problems led to broadside designs being [MASK] by [MASK] that gave greater all @-@ round fire , which [MASK] central @-@ battery , turret , and barbette designs . = = = = <unk> , [MASK] and [MASK] = = = = There were two main design <unk> to the [MASK] . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate [MASK] : this [MASK] was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ [MASK] ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a [MASK] platform to give them a [MASK] field of fire ; when fully armored , this [MASK] was called a turret and when [MASK] armored or <unk> , a barbette . The centre @-@ [MASK] was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more [MASK] method . <unk> guns [MASK] meant the ship could be shorter and <unk> than a [MASK] type . The first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was HMS [MASK] of 1865 ; the French laid down centre @-@ battery [MASK] in 1865 which were not [MASK] until 1870 . Centre @-@ battery ships often , but not [MASK] , had a <unk> <unk> [MASK] some of their guns to fire directly ahead . The [MASK] was first used in naval combat on the USS <unk> in 1862 , with a type of [MASK] designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A [MASK] turret design was [MASK] by the British inventor <unk> <unk> with a [MASK] of this installed on HMS <unk> in 1861 for testing and [MASK] purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a [MASK] spindle , and <unk> 's turned on a ring of [MASK] . <unk> offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but [MASK] were [MASK] problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be [MASK] limited by masts and rigging , so they were [MASK] to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going [MASK] . The second problem was that turrets were [MASK] heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the [MASK] possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by [MASK] designing a ship with very low <unk> . The [MASK] thus saved from having a high [MASK] above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low <unk> , [MASK] , also meant a smaller hull and [MASK] a smaller capacity for coal storage — and [MASK] range of the vessel . In many [MASK] , the <unk> , low @-@ <unk> <unk> and the broadside <unk> HMS Warrior [MASK] two opposite extremes in what an ' [MASK] ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to [MASK] these two extremes , or ' <unk> this circle ' , was [MASK] by Captain <unk> <unk> <unk> : HMS Captain , a [MASK] low <unk> turret ship which [MASK] carried a full rig of sail , and which [MASK] capsized not long after her [MASK] in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was [MASK] to firing from her turrets only on the port and [MASK] beams . The third Royal Navy ship to [MASK] turrets and masts was HMS <unk> of 1876 , which [MASK] two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line , [MASK] both to fire fore , aft and broadside . A lighter [MASK] to the turret , [MASK] popular with the French navy , was the [MASK] . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a <unk> . The crew was [MASK] from direct fire , but [MASK] to <unk> fire , for instance from shore [MASK] . The barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less [MASK] and no roof armor — though [MASK] some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to [MASK] the top @-@ weight of their ships . The [MASK] became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the [MASK] of an armored ' gun @-@ house ' , [MASK] into the turrets of the pre @-@ <unk> [MASK] . = = = <unk> = = = The ironclad age saw the [MASK] of explosive [MASK] as naval weapons , which helped <unk> the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first [MASK] were static mines , used [MASK] in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the [MASK] of the spar torpedo , an [MASK] charge pushed against the hull of a [MASK] by a small boat . For the first time , a large [MASK] faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the [MASK] <unk> of <unk> against [MASK] , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken [MASK] . The U.S. Navy converted four of its [MASK] to become <unk> armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under [MASK] in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another [MASK] , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an [MASK] on a line or <unk> ; [MASK] to deter a ship from <unk> or to make a [MASK] attack by a boat less <unk> . A more practical and [MASK] weapon was the self @-@ [MASK] or Whitehead torpedo . <unk> in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the [MASK] torpedo formed part of the armament of [MASK] of the 1880s like HMS <unk> and the [MASK] <unk> <unk> and Enrico <unk> . The ironclad 's [MASK] to the torpedo was a key part of the [MASK] of armored warships made by the <unk> <unk> school of naval [MASK] ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent [MASK] by [MASK] would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . In [MASK] , however , the <unk> <unk> was only briefly [MASK] and the torpedo formed part of the [MASK] mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads . = = Armor and [MASK] = = The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and [MASK] by [MASK] iron armor backed by thick wooden <unk> . <unk> were still being built with [MASK] hulls into the [MASK] . = = = <unk> : iron , wood and steel = = = Using iron [MASK] for warships offered advantages for the [MASK] of the hull . However , <unk> iron had many military [MASK] , and offered [MASK] problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , [MASK] for long @-@ range cruising warships . Iron ships had first been [MASK] for military use in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , [MASK] , Britain and the United States had all [MASK] with iron @-@ <unk> but <unk> [MASK] and frigates . However , the iron @-@ <unk> frigate was [MASK] by the end of the 1840s , [MASK] iron hulls were more [MASK] to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron [MASK] more likely to fall out of [MASK] than wood . The <unk> of <unk> iron for [MASK] hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for [MASK] when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many [MASK] . Iron allowed larger ships and more [MASK] design , for instance the use of <unk> [MASK] on the lower decks . [MASK] , built of iron , was longer and [MASK] than the wooden @-@ <unk> Gloire . Iron could be produced to order and used [MASK] , in contrast to the need to give wood a long [MASK] of <unk> . And , given the large [MASK] of wood [MASK] to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were [MASK] cost @-@ effective . The main [MASK] for the French use of wooden hulls for the [MASK] fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron [MASK] could not supply enough , and the main reason why [MASK] built its handful of wooden @-@ <unk> [MASK] was to make best use of hulls [MASK] started and wood already bought . Wooden hulls [MASK] to be used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads , because iron [MASK] had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls [MASK] quick <unk> by marine life , slowing the ships down — <unk> for a [MASK] <unk> close to dry docks , but a [MASK] for long @-@ range ships . The only [MASK] was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in [MASK] , a laborious and expensive process which made wooden [MASK] remain attractive . Iron and wood were to some extent [MASK] : the [MASK] <unk> and <unk> ordered in 1875 were [MASK] @-@ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite [MASK] . After 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material for [MASK] . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater [MASK] [MASK] for a lower weight . The French Navy led the way with the use of [MASK] in its fleet , [MASK] with the <unk> , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 . <unk> [MASK] had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her [MASK] hull was iron rather than steel . Even though [MASK] led the world in steel [MASK] , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel [MASK] . The <unk> process for steel manufacture produced too many [MASK] for large @-@ scale use on ships . French [MASK] used the <unk> @-@ Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British [MASK] <unk> behind . The first all @-@ steel [MASK] built by the Royal Navy were the [MASK] vessels <unk> and Mercury , [MASK] down in 1875 and 1876 . = = = Armor and [MASK] schemes = = = Iron @-@ built ships used wood as part of their [MASK] scheme . HMS Warrior was [MASK] by 4 @.@ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of [MASK] iron backed by 15 in ( 381 mm ) of <unk> , the [MASK] [MASK] wood . The wood played two roles , preventing <unk> and also [MASK] the shock of a hit damaging the [MASK] of the ship . Later , wood and iron were [MASK] in ' sandwich ' armor , for [MASK] in HMS <unk> . Steel was also an obvious [MASK] for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too [MASK] and <unk> when struck by shells . Steel became [MASK] to use when a way was [MASK] to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of [MASK] armor . This [MASK] armor was used by the British in [MASK] built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ( [MASK] with HMS <unk> ) and then for all armor ( [MASK] with HMS <unk> of 1882 ) . The French and German navies adopted the [MASK] almost [MASK] , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of [MASK] fused armor . The first [MASK] to have all @-@ steel armor were the [MASK] <unk> <unk> and Enrico <unk> . Though the [MASK] were laid down in 1873 their armor was not [MASK] from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt [MASK] armor for its fleet , but found it [MASK] in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . [MASK] stuck to [MASK] armor until 1889 . The ultimate ironclad armor was case [MASK] nickel @-@ steel . In 1890 , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor [MASK] by the Harvey process and found it [MASK] to compound armor . For [MASK] years ' Harvey steel ' was the state of the art , [MASK] in the U.S. , France , [MASK] , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the German firm <unk> [MASK] gas <unk> , which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser [MASK] III , laid down in 1895 , was the [MASK] ship to [MASK] from the new ' <unk> armor ' and the new armor was [MASK] adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS [MASK] , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new [MASK] used <unk> armor , though the U.S. [MASK] to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade . The [MASK] [MASK] of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( 381 mm ) of [MASK] iron was [MASK] to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of either plain steel or [MASK] iron and steel armor , and to 7 [MASK] 75 in ( 197 mm ) of [MASK] armor or 5 @.@ 75 in ( 146 mm ) of <unk> armor . <unk> [MASK] also <unk> the later debate in [MASK] design between <unk> and ' all @-@ or @-@ [MASK] ' armour design . Warrior was only semi @-@ [MASK] , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and [MASK] . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the [MASK] [MASK] guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected [MASK] . <unk> 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , [MASK] boilers and engines , turrets and [MASK] , and little else . An ingenious arrangement of <unk> @-@ filled [MASK] and <unk> [MASK] was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy [MASK] to her un @-@ armored [MASK] . = = <unk> : steam and sail = = The first ocean @-@ going [MASK] carried masts and sails like their wooden [MASK] , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were [MASK] ; the [MASK] steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only [MASK] " 5 to 9 days coal " , and the [MASK] was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also [MASK] two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had [MASK] screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in [MASK] the steam engine was run at a low <unk> ) , and a <unk> [MASK] which could be [MASK] down to the deck level . Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating [MASK] of the <unk> , or USS <unk> and her [MASK] , <unk> with masts from the [MASK] . The British HMS <unk> , [MASK] in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going [MASK] to <unk> with masts . Her [MASK] role was for combat in the English Channel and other [MASK] waters ; and while her coal [MASK] gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little [MASK] on the other side of the ocean . The <unk> and the [MASK] ships [MASK] by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the [MASK] rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s [MASK] masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was [MASK] on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built [MASK] <unk> [MASK] . During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ [MASK] steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than [MASK] models . The Royal Navy [MASK] to switch to the double @-@ [MASK] engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this [MASK] alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . [MASK] this was due to a [MASK] desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the [MASK] and [MASK] situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would [MASK] a network of coaling stations [MASK] , which would need to be fortified at great [MASK] to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as [MASK] , because of <unk> problems with the [MASK] of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the [MASK] of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in [MASK] as it was in theory . During the 1870s the [MASK] grew between ' first @-@ class ironclads ' or ' [MASK] ' on the one hand , and ' cruising [MASK] ' designed for long @-@ range work on the other . The [MASK] on first @-@ class [MASK] for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing [MASK] , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and [MASK] made a sailing rig [MASK] <unk> . HMS <unk> , launched in 1876 but not [MASK] until 1881 , was the last British [MASK] to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a [MASK] . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad [MASK] . <unk> [MASK] on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had [MASK] the Alma and La <unk> [MASK] as small , long @-@ range [MASK] as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMS <unk> of 1870 . The [MASK] ship [MASK] @-@ Admiral , laid down in 1870 and [MASK] in 1875 , was a model of a fast , long @-@ range [MASK] which was likely to be able to [MASK] and <unk> ships like <unk> . Even the later HMS Shannon , often [MASK] as the first [MASK] armored cruiser , would have been too slow to <unk> [MASK] @-@ Admiral . While Shannon was the last British ship with a [MASK] <unk> , later armored cruisers of the 1870s [MASK] sailing rig , <unk> speed under steam in [MASK] . It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long @-@ range [MASK] warship capable of [MASK] enemy commerce raiders , HMS Warspite , which was [MASK] in 1888 . While sailing rigs were [MASK] for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in [MASK] until the early years of the 20th century . The final [MASK] of ironclad [MASK] was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine , a further [MASK] which was first adopted in HMS Sans [MASK] , laid down in 1885 and [MASK] in 1891 . Many ships also used a forced draught to get [MASK] power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the [MASK] of the steam [MASK] in the mid @-@ 1900s ( decade ) . = = Fleets = = While [MASK] spread rapidly in navies [MASK] , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . Most European nations settled [MASK] on land , and the Royal Navy [MASK] to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France , while providing suitable [MASK] to Britain 's commerce and colonial outposts [MASK] . <unk> [MASK] , for the British Royal Navy , a matter of defending the British Isles first and [MASK] power abroad second . Those naval [MASK] of the latter half of the 19th @-@ century which involved [MASK] normally involved colonial [MASK] or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers . But these [MASK] were often enough to convince British policy @-@ makers of the [MASK] <unk> of strictly naval foreign [MASK] , from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the <unk> [MASK] defences of naval <unk> such as <unk> and [MASK] . There were many types of ironclads : <unk> ships [MASK] to " stand in the line of battle " ; the [MASK] of the battleship . Coastal service and <unk> vessels , [MASK] ' floating batteries ' and ' <unk> <unk> [MASK] for commerce raiding or [MASK] of commerce , called ' armoured <unk> = = = <unk> = = = The United Kingdom [MASK] the [MASK] navy in the world for the whole of the [MASK] period . The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them [MASK] in [MASK] whole range of roles . In the age of sail , the British [MASK] for war depended on the Royal Navy [MASK] a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited [MASK] of <unk> , this was no longer [MASK] , so the British at times [MASK] the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in [MASK] as soon as war broke out . To this end , the Royal Navy [MASK] a series of ' coast @-@ defence [MASK] ' , starting with the <unk> class . These ' <unk> [MASK] ' were markedly [MASK] from the other high @-@ seas ironclads of the period and were an [MASK] precursor of the modern [MASK] . As long @-@ range monitors they could reach [MASK] <unk> , for example . However , they were [MASK] armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and [MASK] ( and enemy monitors ) as the [MASK] monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British [MASK] for an [MASK] mortar bombardment of <unk> by the close of the Crimean War , but never [MASK] running the smoke @-@ ridden , shallow @-@ water [MASK] straight to St. [MASK] with ironclads . Likewise , monitors proved <unk> unable to ' overwhelm ' enemy [MASK] single @-@ handed during the [MASK] conflict , though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour [MASK] made them ideal for running <unk> . <unk> and [MASK] , however , negated these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently [MASK] but never countered [MASK] the period . The British never laid down enough <unk> @-@ class ' [MASK] ' to instantly overwhelm [MASK] , <unk> or even New York City with gunfire . Although [MASK] the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its [MASK] rivals , by the early 1880s [MASK] concern about the threat from France and Germany [MASK] in the Naval Defence Act , which [MASK] the idea of a ' two @-@ power [MASK] ' , that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies [MASK] . This standard provoked aggressive [MASK] in the 1880s and 1890s . British ships did not [MASK] in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's [MASK] only saw action as part of [MASK] battles or one @-@ sided [MASK] like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . <unk> British [MASK] against Ahmed ' <unk> 's Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the [MASK] around the port of [MASK] . A mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships [MASK] Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the [MASK] to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but [MASK] little damage , [MASK] only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually [MASK] , on the other hand , and the [MASK] themselves were typically left intact . Had the [MASK] actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their [MASK] , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the [MASK] British ironclads found it easy ( for [MASK] 's sake ) to simply anchor whilst firing — [MASK] targets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly [MASK] <unk> . The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a [MASK] advantage over the British , but were [MASK] out @-@ built by the [MASK] . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel [MASK] , the [MASK] navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the [MASK] of [MASK] ceased for a while in France as the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought took [MASK] , suggesting that torpedo boats and <unk> [MASK] would be the future of [MASK] . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its [MASK] ; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco @-@ Prussian War was [MASK] , as the war was settled [MASK] on land . Russia built a number of [MASK] , generally copies of British or French designs . [MASK] , there were real [MASK] from Russia ; the first true type of ironclad [MASK] cruiser , the General @-@ Admiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular [MASK] [MASK] to as ' <unk> ' ( for Admiral <unk> , who [MASK] the design ) . The Russian Navy [MASK] the wide @-@ scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo @-@ [MASK] War of 1877 – 1878 , mainly out of [MASK] because of the superior numbers and quality of [MASK] used by the Turkish navy . Russia [MASK] her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and [MASK] , but the ships were manned by [MASK] crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their [MASK] in the Battle of <unk> on 27 May 1905 . The U.S. Navy [MASK] the Civil War with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal [MASK] ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in [MASK] , leaving the USA [MASK] without an ironclad fleet . Another five large [MASK] were ordered in the 1870s . The [MASK] of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from [MASK] power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a [MASK] with even Spain or the Latin [MASK] powers . The 1890s saw the [MASK] of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre @-@ <unk> and [MASK] [MASK] built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – [MASK] War of 1898 . This [MASK] a new era of naval warfare . <unk> were widely used in South America .

The powerful Spanish <unk> [MASK] in the Battle of <unk> but was unable to inflict [MASK] damage to the <unk> [MASK] . Besides , Peru was able to deploy two locally built [MASK] based on American Civil War designs , the <unk> ( a wooden ship [MASK] into a casemate [MASK] ) and the Victoria ( a small monitor armed with a [MASK] 68 @-@ <unk> gun ) , as well as two British @-@ built [MASK] : <unk> , a centre @-@ [MASK] ship , and the turret ship <unk> . <unk> was the first [MASK] to <unk> the world , arriving in <unk> on 20 [MASK] 1867 , and [MASK] the motto : " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " [ " First [MASK] ship to sail [MASK] the world " ] ) . In the War of the [MASK] in 1879 , both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships , [MASK] some of those used a few years [MASK] against Spain . While the <unk> ran aground early on , the [MASK] ironclad ' <unk> made a great impact against Chilean [MASK] , delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months . She was [MASK] caught by two more modern Chilean centre @-@ battery [MASK] , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> at the [MASK] of <unk> Point . <unk> were also used from the [MASK] of the [MASK] Japanese Navy .

The [MASK] of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a [MASK] on the design of [MASK] , producing the type known as the pre @-@ <unk> . These ships are sometimes covered in [MASK] of the ironclad warship . The next evolution of [MASK] design , the [MASK] , is never referred to as an ' ironclad ' . Most of the [MASK] of the 1870s and 1880s [MASK] into the 1900s ( decade ) . For [MASK] , a handful of US navy [MASK] laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I.

Eliot 's Four <unk> , a [MASK] of poems that discuss time , [MASK] , humanity , and [MASK] . It was first published in September 1942 after being [MASK] for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on Great [MASK] during World War II and Eliot 's [MASK] health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in <unk> , [MASK] by Nicholas <unk> in the 17th century and [MASK] during the English Civil War . The poem uses the [MASK] image of fire and <unk> fire to emphasise the need for [MASK] and <unk> . [MASK] to the poet , humanity 's flawed [MASK] of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of [MASK] , but this can be [MASK] by <unk> the lessons of the past . Within the poem , the [MASK] meets a ghost that is a [MASK] of various poets and literary figures . Little <unk> [MASK] on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that [MASK] this unity is necessary for salvation . = = [MASK] = = Following the [MASK] of the third Four <unk> poem , The Dry <unk> , Eliot 's health [MASK] and he stayed in <unk> Green , Surrey while he [MASK] . During this time , Eliot [MASK] writing Little <unk> . The first draft was [MASK] in July 1941 but he was [MASK] with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own [MASK] to write , and that , [MASK] by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little [MASK] and had [MASK] it too quickly . After the first draft was [MASK] , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture [MASK] Great Britain . After months of not [MASK] on the poem , Eliot began to feel [MASK] to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , [MASK] , that he started working on it [MASK] . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 [MASK] 1942 and [MASK] in the October New English Weekly . Little <unk> was [MASK] to conclude the Four <unk> series , <unk> Eliot 's views [MASK] in this series of poems . Little <unk> was the home of an Anglican [MASK] [MASK] in <unk> by Nicholas <unk> . The <unk> household lived a Christian life according to High Church [MASK] and the Book of Common Prayer . The [MASK] community was [MASK] during the English Civil War between <unk> and <unk> but [MASK] , ending with the death of John <unk> in <unk> . Eliot had [MASK] the site in May 1936 . Unlike the other [MASK] mentioned in the titles of the Four <unk> poems , Eliot had no [MASK] [MASK] to the original Christian community . As such , the [MASK] is supposed to represent almost any religious community . = = Poem = = Critics [MASK] Little <unk> as a poem of fire with an [MASK] on <unk> and the <unk> fire . The [MASK] of the poem [MASK] time and winter , with attention paid to the [MASK] of summer . The images of snow , which provoke desires for a spiritual life , [MASK] into an analysis of the four [MASK] elements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the [MASK] element of the four . Following this is a [MASK] on death and [MASK] , things <unk> , and regret for past [MASK] . While using Dante 's <unk> <unk> style , the poem continues by [MASK] the Battle of Britain . The image of warfare <unk> with the [MASK] of <unk> , and the Holy Spirit is [MASK] with the air @-@ raids on [MASK] . In the second section , a ghost , [MASK] the poets of the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the [MASK] of the poem . The ghost [MASK] change , art in general , and how [MASK] is flawed . The only way to overcome the [MASK] condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to [MASK] <unk> through fire . The fire is [MASK] in a manner similar to Julian of [MASK] 's writing about God 's love and discussed in [MASK] to the shirt of <unk> , a shirt that burns its wearer . Little <unk> [MASK] by [MASK] the <unk> of the present and how history exists in a pattern . The poem concludes by [MASK] how sacrifice is needed to allow an [MASK] to die into life and be reborn , and that [MASK] should be the goal of [MASK] . = = Themes = = In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that [MASK] was needed for all of [MASK] before new life could begin . The original Little <unk> [MASK] was built for living on monastic lines , but the [MASK] was damaged and [MASK] by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646 . The [MASK] , the centre of the [MASK] , was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The image of [MASK] renewal is combined with the image of the London air @-@ raids and the [MASK] fighting and [MASK] within the world . This compound image is used to discuss the [MASK] of holy places with the Holy Spirit , <unk> , [MASK] with the dead , and the [MASK] of history . The theme is also [MASK] to Eliot 's own poems ; the image of the rose [MASK] at the end Little <unk> is the image that begins <unk> Norton and the [MASK] is made circular . Also , the [MASK] of time within the poem is similar to the way time [MASK] within The [MASK] <unk> . Like the other poems making up the Four <unk> , [MASK] <unk> deals with the past , present , and future , and [MASK] 's place within them as each [MASK] is seemingly united . In the second [MASK] , there is a ghost who is the [MASK] of various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and [MASK] . When the ghost joins the poet , the [MASK] states " Knowing myself yet being someone other " . This suggests that the [MASK] times merge at the same time that the different [MASK] begin to merge , allowing a [MASK] and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth [MASK] , [MASK] is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London ; redemption or [MASK] . God 's love allows [MASK] to be <unk> and escape the living hell [MASK] <unk> by fire . The end of the poem [MASK] how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . He [MASK] his work in [MASK] with working on the soul or working on society . The ghost , a [MASK] of many literary figures , was [MASK] addressed in the poem as " <unk> <unk> " before being revised as an [MASK] " you " . " [MASK] <unk> " was Dante 's way of [MASK] <unk> <unk> , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been [MASK] for <unk> . Eliot , in a [MASK] to John <unk> dated 27 August 1942 , [MASK] why he changed the wording : I think you will [MASK] that it was [MASK] to get rid of <unk> for two reasons . The first is that the [MASK] figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be [MASK] by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean [MASK] so [MASK] as that . However , I do not wish to take the [MASK] of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to [MASK] to him the [MASK] vice which took <unk> there . <unk> , although the [MASK] to that <unk> is intended to be [MASK] , I wish the effect of the whole to be <unk> which is more [MASK] . That brings us to the [MASK] to swimming in fire which you will [MASK] at the end of <unk> 26 where the poets are found . The theme of [MASK] through flames is [MASK] to the depiction of <unk> <unk> , a poet that [MASK] Dante , seeking such a state in <unk> <unk> . However , the [MASK] of swimming was [MASK] into an image of dancing , an act that appears [MASK] Yeats 's poetry , within <unk> flames . The critic Dominic <unk> suggests that , in [MASK] the image of [MASK] with <unk> , Eliot <unk> Dante 's and Yeats 's poetic themes . = = [MASK] = = [MASK] such as Malcolm <unk> and <unk> <unk> [MASK] mixed emotions about the <unk> of the poem . <unk> [MASK] the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than <unk> while [MASK] his [MASK] of many of the passages . <unk> also mentioned the Buddhist images and his [MASK] for many of the lines in Little <unk> . F. B. <unk> [MASK] that the fourth [MASK] of the poem costs " Eliot more [MASK] and <unk> than any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest [MASK] in the Four <unk> . " E. M. [MASK] did not like Eliot 's emphasis on pain and [MASK] to the poem : " Of [MASK] there 's pain on and off through each [MASK] 's life ... You can 't <unk> it and so on . But why [MASK] it be endorsed by the [MASK] and <unk> by the [MASK] until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by [MASK] and <unk> ? It is here that Eliot becomes [MASK] as a seer . " [MASK] in 2003 , Roger <unk> wrote that in " Little <unk> " Eliot [MASK] " that for which he <unk> Dante — [MASK] , a poetry of [MASK] , in which belief and words are one , and in which the [MASK] cannot be prized free from the [MASK] and beautiful language " . = The [MASK] to San <unk> of <unk> = The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> is a 1981 literary and [MASK] [MASK] by George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a [MASK] Adolf Hitler ( <unk> ) alive in the [MASK] jungle thirty years after the end of World War II . The book generated [MASK] controversy after its [MASK] because in it , Steiner , who is Jewish , allows Hitler to defend [MASK] when he is put on trial in the jungle by his [MASK] . There Hitler [MASK] that Israel <unk> its existence to the Holocaust and that he is the " [MASK] of the Jews " . The [MASK] to San <unk> of <unk> was a 1983 <unk> in the <unk> / [MASK] Award for [MASK] . It was adapted for the theatre by British playwright [MASK] Hampton and was staged in London in April 1982 with Alec <unk> [MASK] the part of Adolf Hitler . It was also staged in Hartford , [MASK] in the United States in 1983 and [MASK] John <unk> as Hitler . = = Plot [MASK] = = From his base in Tel Aviv , [MASK] survivor Emmanuel <unk> directs a group of Jewish Nazi [MASK] in search of Adolf Hitler . <unk> [MASK] that the former <unk> is still alive , and [MASK] rumours and <unk> , he tracks Hitler 's [MASK] through South America , until after months of wading [MASK] swamps in the Amazon jungle , the [MASK] party finds the 90 @-@ year @-@ old alive in a [MASK] . <unk> flies to San <unk> where he awaits the group 's return with their [MASK] . But [MASK] the old man out of the jungle alive is more [MASK] than getting in , and their progress is further hampered by heavy [MASK] . Meanwhile , broken and [MASK] radio messages between <unk> and the search party are intercepted by [MASK] agents tracking their progress , and [MASK] begin to spread across the world of Hitler 's capture . <unk> flare up over his [MASK] trial , where it will be held and under whose [MASK] . <unk> is [MASK] as the nearest airfield to the last known [MASK] of the search party , and aircraft begin [MASK] at the hitherto unknown town . But when the search party loses radio [MASK] with <unk> , they must make a [MASK] : do they sit out the storms and [MASK] their captive to <unk> later , or do they try [MASK] in the jungle before their prize is [MASK] from them by the world at large , who they know will be waiting ? Their [MASK] is the latter , and [MASK] <unk> 's advice ( " You must not let him speak ... his [MASK] is like no other " ) they [MASK] for a trial with a judge , [MASK] and defence attorneys selected from the [MASK] of the search party . <unk> , a local Indian <unk> , is asked to [MASK] the trial as an [MASK] witness . The attention Hitler is receiving , however , <unk> his [MASK] , and when the trial begins , he <unk> aside his " defence [MASK] " and [MASK] a long speech in four parts in his own [MASK] : Firstly , Hitler claims he took his [MASK] from the Jews and copied the notion of the [MASK] race from the <unk> people and their need to separate [MASK] from the " <unk> " . " My racism is a parody of <unk> , a hungry [MASK] . " Hitler <unk> the Final <unk> by [MASK] that the Jews ' God , [MASK] than any other , <unk> its subjects , [MASK] demanding more than they can give and " <unk> " them with [MASK] that cannot be [MASK] . The " virus of <unk> " had to be [MASK] . Hitler states that he was not the [MASK] of evil . " [ Stalin ] had [MASK] <unk> when I was still a <unk> <unk> in Munich . " [MASK] , Hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his [MASK] are <unk> by various world [MASK] , including those in Russia , China and Africa . Lastly , Hitler [MASK] that the Reich <unk> Israel and [MASK] that he is the <unk> " whose [MASK] <unk> were allowed by God in order to bring His [MASK] home . " He closes by asking , " [MASK] you not honour me who have made ... <unk> a [MASK] ? " At the end of his [MASK] , <unk> is the first to react and jumps up [MASK] " <unk> " , only to be drowned out by the [MASK] of a helicopter over the clearing . = = Main [MASK] = = Emmanuel <unk> – Jewish [MASK] survivor and director of the search party to find [MASK] ; after <unk> out of a death pit in [MASK] he never took the time to <unk> and embarked on a life @-@ [MASK] obsession to bring those [MASK] for the <unk> to justice . Search party ( all Jewish with family ties to the [MASK] , [MASK] for John Asher ) <unk> – search party leader and " [MASK] judge " at Hitler 's trial ; he is <unk> 's <unk> and torn [MASK] leading the [MASK] into " <unk> <unk> and green <unk> " and [MASK] his back on the " quiet <unk> of <unk> 's [MASK] " . Gideon <unk> – falls ill and dies [MASK] the trial begins ; during one of his fever @-@ induced <unk> he [MASK] that Hitler is Jewish ; he had sought out <unk> after being [MASK] from a <unk> and [MASK] three years <unk> in Paris where the care @-@ free living [MASK] him with guilt . Elie <unk> – Orthodox Jew and " [MASK] attorney " at the [MASK] ; he is the moral <unk> of the group , but his [MASK] are disturbed by Gideon <unk> 's fever @-@ [MASK] <unk> that Hitler is Jewish and ends up [MASK] that Hitler may be the second [MASK] . Isaac <unk> – an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and [MASK] at the trial ; he is the son of Isaac <unk> [MASK] , former member of the search party killed [MASK] in a <unk> in São Paulo ; he [MASK] the party to avenge his father 's death . John Asher – half @-@ [MASK] and reluctant " defence attorney " at the trial ; [MASK] by the capture of <unk> and the rumours [MASK] that Hitler may be alive , he had [MASK] Nazi hunter <unk> who [MASK] him to <unk> ; despite being an " <unk> " ( no ties to the [MASK] ) <unk> [MASK] him to the search party because of his [MASK] training and his clear @-@ <unk> ( " no [MASK] lusts , no <unk> for <unk> " ) . <unk> – local Indian <unk> and [MASK] witness at the trial ; [MASK] the search party 's guide who had [MASK] them when they insisted on entering <unk> regions of the jungle , he [MASK] tracking them from a distance before [MASK] himself . Adolf Hitler – now 90 years old , the [MASK] leader of the Third Reich had not died in the <unk> in Berlin , but [MASK] to South [MASK] and hid in the Amazon jungle . = = Background and [MASK] = = George Steiner , [MASK] critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times , had written about the [MASK] in some of his previous books , [MASK] <unk> <unk> ( 1964 ) , [MASK] and Silence ( 1967 ) and In <unk> 's [MASK] ( 1971 ) . Many of the ideas Steiner [MASK] in The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> were [MASK] from these earlier works . Steiner told New York Times [MASK] D. J. R. <unk> that this book arose out of his [MASK] work on language . " Central to [MASK] I am and believe and have written is my <unk> ... that you can use human [MASK] both to [MASK] , to love , to build , to [MASK] and also to torture , to hate , to destroy and to <unk> . " [MASK] on the [MASK] the book generated , Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron <unk> ( author of [MASK] Hitler ) that he too was [MASK] by it , adding that his [MASK] Hitler had gotten the better of him , " [MASK] or <unk> @-@ like " . He said that it felt like the book " [MASK] me " . [MASK] also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the [MASK] , but also about the horrific events that took place in [MASK] like [MASK] , Vietnam , El Salvador and <unk> : " My [MASK] is that one has to <unk> with the <unk> if one can . " [MASK] wrote The Portage to San [MASK] of <unk> in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , [MASK] , and the 120 @-@ page work [MASK] appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States [MASK] magazine , The Kenyon Review . It also [MASK] in the Spring 1980 issue of <unk> , the British literary magazine . Its first [MASK] in book form , with minor [MASK] by Steiner , was in May 1981 by <unk> and <unk> in the United [MASK] — and as [MASK] by Steiner , it was a paperback original . The first United States edition was [MASK] in [MASK] in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster . = = [MASK] = = The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was [MASK] for the theatre in 1982 by British playwright [MASK] Hampton . It was staged in April 1982 at London 's <unk> Theatre under the [MASK] of John Dexter with Alec <unk> [MASK] the part of Adolf Hitler . <unk> won the 1982 Evening [MASK] Theatre Award for best actor for this [MASK] . In 1983 the production moved to the [MASK] States where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford , [MASK] , directed by Mark <unk> and [MASK] John <unk> as Hitler . This book is the only work of [MASK] by Steiner to have been adapted for the stage . = = [MASK] = = [MASK] to The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was mixed . Anthony <unk> in The [MASK] called it " [MASK] " , Christopher Booker of The Daily [MASK] described it as a " powerful piece " , and [MASK] author A. S. <unk> said it was a " [MASK] " . In Explaining Hitler , Ron <unk> called The Portage " A <unk> story " , [MASK] to [MASK] 's <unk> Hitler has having taken on a life of its own . Writing in Time [MASK] , Otto [MASK] described the book " a <unk> fantasy of [MASK] intensity " , adding that by not <unk> Hitler 's speech , Steiner <unk> from the <unk> of [MASK] Holocaust [MASK] and ends the book " on a note of bleak [MASK] " . Morris <unk> of The New York Times was more [MASK] of the book , calling it " a <unk> and badly [MASK] novel , a <unk> [MASK] from the serious business of thinking through the <unk> <unk> of the Nazi era . " He [MASK] it as " [MASK] " that is " <unk> [ d ] " by too much " fine [MASK] " ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . He also [MASK] that the [MASK] are lifeless , and while they each have detailed [MASK] , they are only " verbal <unk> " that do not [MASK] them from one another . Finally <unk> noted that [MASK] almost all the points of Hitler 's speech are drawn from some of [MASK] 's earlier works , he " [MASK] creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also <unk> and [MASK] — at once <unk> harmless and <unk> [MASK] . " In [MASK] review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its [MASK] points , " some wit , a <unk> disdain , [MASK] of [MASK] and a South American swamp @-@ life that <unk> " , its [MASK] are that " the characters are really ideas , ... the [MASK] clash and there are too many [MASK] of better books by <unk> and <unk> " . But Leonard 's biggest [MASK] of the book was Hitler 's speech , which he called " [MASK] " , and Steiner 's [MASK] to end the book at that point , which [MASK] said " not only denies the power of art to arrange and [MASK] , but ... makes me sick to my [MASK] . " Writing in the [MASK] literary magazine <unk> , Alvin H. <unk> called The Portage a " [MASK] work " that " <unk> " . He was [MASK] by the book 's [MASK] between the landscape of swamp and jungle , and the " [MASK] of speech " — the former being " [MASK] registered " with its " immense feeling of <unk> " , and the [MASK] , " even more [MASK] " in the way it exposes " the dark [MASK] of words " and how its use and misuse [MASK] the true nature of a person . He was [MASK] impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel <unk> and his role as [MASK] of the Jewish consciousness . <unk> noted that while Holocaust [MASK] often either <unk> to " <unk> and [MASK] " , or sinks to " a <unk> <unk> of [MASK] lament " , Steiner 's <unk> " <unk> between these two [MASK] , ... [MASK] records and <unk> , <unk> <unk> yet carries an immense affect " . What did concern the [MASK] , [MASK] , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them " [MASK] <unk> " into Hitler 's mouth , creating the [MASK] that " Steiner 's [MASK] of Hitler were identical with the latter 's self @-@ [MASK] " . <unk> also [MASK] why the book had to end with Hitler 's speech . He said that [MASK] 's <unk> Hitler plays " the devil 's game of language [MASK] " , making " [MASK] [ sound ] like music " , [MASK] the real Hitler had <unk> . By stopping at this point , <unk> felt that [MASK] " <unk> [ s ] , <unk> , to the [MASK] <unk> of negation " , which <unk> his own " high [MASK] of moral [MASK] " . But overall <unk> said The Portage " must be counted among the most [MASK] attempts to portray the [MASK] and meaning of Hitler " , forcing us to [MASK] him " in a way hardly seen before in [MASK] " . The Portage to San [MASK] of <unk> was a <unk> in the 1983 <unk> / Faulkner Award for Fiction . = = [MASK] = = The book generated [MASK] controversy because of its apparent " admiration for Hitler " . The [MASK] grew further when the faithful stage [MASK] ( " too faithful " , [MASK] to Steiner ) was performed in the United [MASK] and the United States . Hitler 's speech at the end of the book [MASK] many readers and critics . [MASK] not only lets Hitler justify his past , he [MASK] him the ( almost ) last word before the [MASK] world invades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more [MASK] . One critic , while [MASK] that Steiner always saw Hitler as " the incarnation of [MASK] and unparalleled evil " , felt that there was no clear [MASK] in the book [MASK] Steiner 's own views and those of his [MASK] Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish [MASK] and is a critic of Israel 's treatment of the [MASK] , of anti @-@ [MASK] . In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner 's [MASK] for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his [MASK] stated belief " that Hitler wielded [MASK] as an almost [MASK] force " , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel <unk> 's warning from the book [MASK] Hitler : " [MASK] shall come a man who ... will know the [MASK] of hell and teach it to others . He will know the sounds of [MASK] and <unk> and make them seem music . " Steiner [MASK] to criticism that [MASK] 's speech in this book is <unk> by saying that it had been done before : for [MASK] Satan 's speech in Milton 's [MASK] Lost ( 1667 ) , and The Grand <unk> 's [MASK] in <unk> 's The [MASK] <unk> ( 1880 ) . He also reminded the reader that Hitler 's speech is [MASK] out earlier in the book by <unk> 's long [MASK] on the <unk> of the [MASK] . Finally , Steiner said that his [MASK] ( A. H. ) is " a <unk> [MASK] " , and that it is not he who has the last word , but <unk> , the [MASK] <unk> , who [MASK] " <unk> " . <unk> is also the Hebrew word used to [MASK] that " there are [MASK] here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide . " = [MASK] = <unk> ( from Greek <unk> ( [MASK] , " to cut " ) and <unk> ( [MASK] , " <unk> " ) ) is a [MASK] <unk> of extinct small to giant <unk> — often [MASK] primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> [MASK] . A few species continued into the [MASK] . <unk> have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of [MASK] history , they adapted to a wide range of [MASK] , including fresh water , [MASK] , and even coastal marine [MASK] . Their life history is well understood , with [MASK] known from the <unk> stage , <unk> , and [MASK] . Most <unk> were <unk> , although some were almost fully [MASK] , returning to the water only to [MASK] . These <unk> were some of the first [MASK] fully adapted to life on land . Although <unk> are considered amphibians , many had [MASK] , such as [MASK] , claws , and armour @-@ like bony plates , that [MASK] them from modern amphibians . <unk> have been known since the early 19th [MASK] , and were [MASK] thought to be reptiles . They were described at [MASK] times as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , [MASK] these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in <unk> were spread out among several [MASK] groups until the early 20th [MASK] , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the [MASK] of their [MASK] . <unk> means " cut vertebrae " , as each <unk> is [MASK] into several parts . Experts disagree over whether <unk> were ancestral to modern [MASK] ( [MASK] , <unk> , and <unk> ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any [MASK] . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the [MASK] of <unk> , [MASK] group of early <unk> called <unk> , or even as [MASK] of both groups ( with <unk> [MASK] from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolving from <unk> ) . Recent [MASK] place a family of <unk> called the <unk> as the closest relatives of modern [MASK] . <unk> in teeth , skulls , and hearing [MASK] link the two groups . = = [MASK] = = Many <unk> are much larger than living [MASK] , and [MASK] resemble <unk> . Others are smaller and resemble <unk> . Most have broad , flat heads that are [MASK] blunt ( <unk> ) or [MASK] ( <unk> ) . The skulls are rounded or [MASK] in shape when viewed from above , and are [MASK] covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have [MASK] blood vessels , which could [MASK] carbon dioxide to the bones to [MASK] acidic build up in the blood ( early <unk> <unk> would have had [MASK] <unk> carbon dioxide from their [MASK] while on land , and these dermal bones may have been an early [MASK] to the problem ) . Many <unk> also have canal @-@ like [MASK] in their skulls called [MASK] <unk> . The <unk> , which usually run around the [MASK] and eye <unk> , are part of a [MASK] line system used to detect <unk> in water . As <unk> [MASK] , most <unk> have [MASK] limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . [MASK] <unk> have larger , [MASK] limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual [MASK] <unk> , <unk> , has relatively long limbs for its body , and [MASK] lived as an [MASK] runner able to chase prey . <unk> of most of the [MASK] of <unk> are also seen in [MASK] early <unk> , aside from a few bones in the [MASK] , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that have [MASK] in some <unk> taxa . Most [MASK] have <unk> horns in the backs of their skulls , rounded [MASK] of bone separated from the rest of the skull by <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> ; in some <unk> , such as <unk> , they are [MASK] and very prominent . Among the most [MASK] features of [MASK] are the <unk> <unk> , two large holes in the back of the palate . [MASK] pair of holes , <unk> , are [MASK] in front of these <unk> , and [MASK] the nasal passage with the mouth . [MASK] often have teeth on their <unk> , as well as in [MASK] jaws . Some of these teeth are so large , they are [MASK] to as <unk> . In some [MASK] , such as <unk> , <unk> in the lower jaw <unk> the palate and emerge through [MASK] in the top of the skull . Very [MASK] is known of the soft [MASK] of <unk> . A block of [MASK] , described in 2007 from the Early <unk> <unk> <unk> Formation of [MASK] , included impressions of the bodies of three <unk> . These [MASK] show , when alive , they had [MASK] skin , robust limbs with [MASK] feet , and a ridge of skin on their [MASK] . <unk> <unk> to small <unk> have also been [MASK] in <unk> and <unk> rocks . The <unk> , called <unk> , are usually found in strata [MASK] around freshwater [MASK] , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water . Unlike modern [MASK] , many <unk> are [MASK] in small , closely packed scales . The <unk> of most <unk> are [MASK] in rows of large ventral plates . During early stages of [MASK] , they first have only small , [MASK] scales . <unk> show , as the [MASK] grew , the scales on the <unk> of their bodies [MASK] into large , wide ventral plates . The plates [MASK] each other in a way that allows a wide range of [MASK] . Later <unk> <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , have no [MASK] of [MASK] . They may have lost scales to make [MASK] easier under water or to allow <unk> <unk> , the [MASK] of oxygen through the skin . Several groups of <unk> have large bony [MASK] on their backs . One <unk> , <unk> , has armour @-@ like [MASK] that covers both its back and [MASK] . The <unk> <unk> also has [MASK] plating on its back . Most members of the family <unk> also have armor , [MASK] it only covers the [MASK] of the back with two [MASK] rows of plates . Other <unk> , such as [MASK] , have been found with small , disc @-@ like bony <unk> that were in life [MASK] embedded in the skin . All of these <unk> were [MASK] to a [MASK] lifestyle . Armor may have offered protection from [MASK] in the case of <unk> . The <unk> may have provided [MASK] for the spine , as they would have limited [MASK] and may have been connected by strong [MASK] . <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> that may have been at least partly [MASK] also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have [MASK] the [MASK] . <unk> <unk> are also seen in <unk> , but [MASK] <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , these [MASK] are thought to have been fully aquatic . <unk> may have [MASK] their armor from a [MASK] ancestor , as both <unk> and <unk> have been [MASK] close relatives of the group . <unk> ' vertebrae are divided into several [MASK] . In living <unk> , the main body of the <unk> is a [MASK] piece of bone [MASK] the <unk> , but in <unk> , this region was [MASK] into a <unk> and <unk> . Two types of vertebrae are [MASK] in <unk> : <unk> and <unk> [MASK] . In <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> are large and wedge @-@ [MASK] , and the <unk> are [MASK] small blocks that fit between them . Both [MASK] support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed <unk> [MASK] called <unk> strengthen the connections between [MASK] . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many <unk> <unk> allowed them to be [MASK] , and in some cases fully , [MASK] . In <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> have been lost [MASK] , with the <unk> enlarged as the main body of the [MASK] . This weaker type of backbone [MASK] the <unk> <unk> spent more time in water . = = [MASK] of study = = <unk> was named by [MASK] <unk> Karl Alfred von <unk> in his second [MASK] of <unk> der <unk> , [MASK] in 1888 . <unk> remains were known since the early part of the 19th [MASK] , however . The earliest [MASK] <unk> was <unk> , named by Georg [MASK] <unk> in 1828 . <unk> named <unk> from a single tooth , and [MASK] it a reptile . <unk> means " [MASK] tooth lizard " after the <unk> @-@ like [MASK] of the tip of the tooth . The naming of these first [MASK] was disputed , however . [MASK] <unk> named the animal <unk> in 1837 . In 1841 , English <unk> Richard Owen [MASK] to the genus as <unk> to [MASK] its highly folded or <unk> teeth . Owen [MASK] the name <unk> " ought not to be [MASK] , because it recalls <unk> the idea of the [MASK] genus <unk> , or else a <unk> form of the tooth ... and [MASK] the second element of the word , <unk> , [MASK] a false affinity , the remains [MASK] , not to the <unk> , but to the <unk> order of <unk> . " Owen [MASK] the animal was not a " <unk> " [MASK] , yet he also [MASK] <unk> 's <unk> to the genus . Although the two genera both have [MASK] sized conical teeth , <unk> was later found to be a [MASK] @-@ like reptile . [MASK] material , including skulls , firmly placed <unk> as an [MASK] . <unk> also named <unk> <unk> in 1828 , basing it on [MASK] <unk> , or back [MASK] of the skull . In 1833 , he [MASK] a complete skull of S. <unk> that had the same teeth as his <unk> , [MASK] it the first known [MASK] skull of a <unk> . Because <unk> was named first , it has [MASK] over the other names as a senior <unk> [MASK] . <unk> is still used as the name of an [MASK] <unk> <unk> . <unk> and other similar animals were [MASK] to as <unk> , named like <unk> for teeth that were [MASK] folded in cross [MASK] . Owen 's " <unk> <unk> " was later found at Guy 's <unk> , [MASK] by [MASK] William Buckland . Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of [MASK] . As more fossils were [MASK] in England , Owen depicted these <unk> as the " highest " form of <unk> and [MASK] them to <unk> , which he [MASK] the highest form of reptiles . He also [MASK] the large <unk> of the <unk> ( a unit of [MASK] that dates to the Late <unk> ) were younger than more [MASK] reptiles in the [MASK] and <unk> , which are Late <unk> in age . Owen used these [MASK] to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a <unk> [MASK] from early amphibians ( what he [MASK] " <unk> fishes " ) . In [MASK] to <unk> , some of the earliest named genera [MASK] <unk> and <unk> in 1842 , <unk> in 1848 , [MASK] in 1849 , <unk> and <unk> in 1853 , [MASK] in 1858 , and <unk> in 1859 . <unk> is now placed as an early <unk> [MASK] <unk> , and <unk> is now [MASK] a <unk> reptile . Later in the 19th century , <unk> were [MASK] as various members of <unk> , a name coined by [MASK] [MASK] Edward <unk> Cope in 1868 . Cope placed <unk> in the [MASK] <unk> , the name then used for <unk> . <unk> means " roof @-@ [MASK] " in Greek , a [MASK] to the wide , flat heads of <unk> and other early <unk> . [MASK] this time , <unk> [MASK] <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile [MASK] , [MASK] they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not [MASK] at the [MASK] of the rib cage ; and deep pits in the skull that were [MASK] as space for <unk> glands . Several <unk> of <unk> were [MASK] in the late 19th and early 20th [MASK] . Animals now regarded as <unk> were primarily <unk> , but some were [MASK] in the <unk> . <unk> were small @-@ [MASK] and had simple [MASK] teeth , while <unk> were larger and had [MASK] , folded <unk> and enamel in their teeth . <unk> [MASK] only a few forms , such as <unk> from Europe and <unk> from North [MASK] , that had poorly [MASK] bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some [MASK] of <unk> were later found with long ribs , [MASK] its <unk> to <unk> ( although more [MASK] studies found it to be a <unk> ) . Soft tissue , such as scales and [MASK] gills , were found in many well @-@ [MASK] <unk> fossils from [MASK] . In the early 20th century , <unk> would be [MASK] as <unk> forms of <unk> lacking many of the typical [MASK] that define the group , and is no longer [MASK] as a distinct group . Other animals that would later be [MASK] as <unk> were placed in a group called <unk> , [MASK] by plate @-@ like [MASK] bones , small limbs , fish @-@ like [MASK] , and <unk> arches . Unlike <unk> , they did not have [MASK] <unk> , small holes in their [MASK] behind their eye <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were [MASK] in this group and were [MASK] to be the most primitive members of <unk> . Their <unk> [MASK] , <unk> , and lack of <unk> <unk> ( which [MASK] the head to the neck ) were [MASK] that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were [MASK] a link between early fishes and more [MASK] forms such as <unk> . Another group called <unk> was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope [MASK] <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> , [MASK] many small , [MASK] @-@ like animals within it . Among them were <unk> , once [MASK] in <unk> . <unk> was later [MASK] as a <unk> with other <unk> , but confusion existed for many years over the [MASK] of small [MASK] . By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today [MASK] as <unk> were placed in the suborder <unk> . American [MASK] <unk> <unk> Case [MASK] it <unk> <unk> or " true <unk> " . The [MASK] <unk> and <unk> were used <unk> to refer to the order in which it [MASK] . The <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , both of which [MASK] <unk> , were [MASK] from <unk> . Within <unk> were the groups <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . [MASK] of [MASK] , such as <unk> and <unk> , had <unk> [MASK] with enlarged <unk> that displaced the <unk> . <unk> , such as [MASK] , <unk> , and <unk> , had lost [MASK] <unk> , and the <unk> made up the entire body of the [MASK] . <unk> had <unk> and [MASK] that were of equal size . <unk> are now [MASK] as <unk> distantly related to <unk> . In 1888 , von <unk> [MASK] <unk> among three taxa : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . He [MASK] <unk> in <unk> , a group which he [MASK] as having simple , <unk> @-@ shaped <unk> <unk> . <unk> [MASK] forms with the <unk> [MASK] into <unk> and <unk> . All members of <unk> had <unk> <unk> [MASK] only of the <unk> . Cope objected to von <unk> 's [MASK] , considering the vertebrae of <unk> and <unk> [MASK] because each had a simple <unk> shape . He [MASK] to use <unk> and <unk> ( which he [MASK] referred to as <unk> ) to [MASK] animals based on the absence or [MASK] of <unk> <unk> . <unk> became a commonly used name at the turn of the [MASK] . <unk> [MASK] both <unk> and <unk> in the group . Cope 's [MASK] and <unk> fell out of use . In 1919 , British [MASK] D. M. S. Watson proposed that the [MASK] history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their [MASK] . <unk> forms in the <unk> [MASK] into <unk> forms in the <unk> , and finally into <unk> in the <unk> . More [MASK] , [MASK] began using the term <unk> to refer to these [MASK] . The name <unk> was rarely used in the decades that followed . Swedish [MASK] <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> removed <unk> from the group , [MASK] its scope to <unk> and <unk> . His [MASK] of <unk> was based heavily on [MASK] of the skull rather than the vertebrae . American [MASK] Alfred <unk> brought the name <unk> back into use in the later 20th [MASK] . <unk> @-@ <unk> used the name <unk> in a [MASK] sense ( [MASK] <unk> ) to refer to <unk> and <unk> , excluding <unk> . <unk> agreed with this [MASK] , but used the name <unk> to avoid [MASK] with <unk> in its wider sense ( <unk> <unk> ) . [MASK] modern <unk> [MASK] , however , <unk> included the primitive <unk> in the group . = = <unk> [MASK] = = = = = [MASK] and Early <unk> = = = <unk> first [MASK] in the Early <unk> around 330 million years ago ( <unk> ) . [MASK] the <unk> , <unk> [MASK] basal medium @-@ sized forms such as <unk> or [MASK] <unk> forms such as <unk> . Other , more [MASK] <unk> , such as the <unk> , were smaller and more [MASK] . They resembled <unk> , and some taxa , such as the [MASK] <unk> , even [MASK] external gills like the modern @-@ day <unk> . [MASK] the latest <unk> and Early <unk> around 300 <unk> , [MASK] groups , such as the <unk> and <unk> evolved strong , robust limbs and [MASK] and became adapted to life on land while [MASK] such as the <unk> , [MASK] into large <unk> predators . The <unk> , a group of small aquatic <unk> , evolved from [MASK] [MASK] in the Late <unk> . = = = Late <unk> = = = During the Late <unk> , [MASK] <unk> and the <unk> of reptiles [MASK] into a decline in [MASK] <unk> , but <unk> and fully aquatic <unk> [MASK] to <unk> , including the large <unk> of Eastern Europe . Other <unk> , such as <unk> , [MASK] long <unk> and a close [MASK] to <unk> , although they lacked the armor [MASK] of the latter group . These <unk> included the largest known [MASK] , the 9 @-@ m @-@ long <unk> of [MASK] . = = = <unk> = = = As <unk> [MASK] to <unk> and [MASK] in the Late <unk> ( 260 @.@ 4 - 251 @.@ 0 [MASK] ) , a major group called <unk> became more [MASK] on life in the water . The [MASK] became weak , the limbs small , and the [MASK] large and flat , with the eyes facing [MASK] . During the <unk> period , these animals dominated the [MASK] ecosystems , evolving in a range of both small and large forms . [MASK] the Early <unk> ( 251 @.@ 0 - 245 @.@ 0 [MASK] ) one group of [MASK] long @-@ <unk> fish @-@ <unk> , the <unk> , even [MASK] to a life in the sea , the only known [MASK] to do so with the [MASK] of the modern crab @-@ eating frog . Another group , the <unk> , [MASK] <unk> and large @-@ sized [MASK] 2 @.@ 3 to 4 m ( 7 [MASK] 5 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) in [MASK] , with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the [MASK] forms such as <unk> . These [MASK] spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic [MASK] , catching their prey by a sudden [MASK] of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small [MASK] . In the <unk> [MASK] of the Late <unk> ( 228 @.@ 0 - 216 @.@ 5 <unk> ) , <unk> were [MASK] by the [MASK] very similar <unk> . <unk> are distinguished from <unk> by the [MASK] of their eye <unk> near the front of their skulls . [MASK] group of <unk> , the <unk> , had wide heads with [MASK] gills , and [MASK] to life at the bottom of lakes and [MASK] . By this time , <unk> had become a common and [MASK] component of <unk> ecosystems . Some <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , even inhabited [MASK] , which was covered in [MASK] forests at the time . <unk> <unk> were often the [MASK] <unk> animals in their [MASK] . Large <unk> of <unk> with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the [MASK] United States . They have often been [MASK] as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain [MASK] . Recent studies show these dense <unk> were instead [MASK] the result of currents [MASK] dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little [MASK] , as they were inhabited almost [MASK] by <unk> . The <unk> @-@ Jurassic [MASK] event around 199 @.@ 6 <unk> led to the [MASK] of most <unk> <unk> . The <unk> survived , as well as a few [MASK] and <unk> . While the latter two groups soon became extinct , <unk> [MASK] and grew to large sizes during the [MASK] . Among <unk> , the <unk> [MASK] in China and the <unk> [MASK] common in <unk> . The most recent known <unk> was the [MASK] <unk> <unk> , known from the Early [MASK] of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for <unk> that [MASK] would have [MASK] with them . <unk> was one of the largest of the <unk> , with an [MASK] weight of [MASK] kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) . = = [MASK] = = Originally , <unk> were classified [MASK] to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae [MASK] of a number of separate [MASK] , were placed in the suborder <unk> , and large <unk> aquatic forms with simpler [MASK] were placed in the [MASK] <unk> . With the recent growth of <unk> , this [MASK] is no longer viable . The basic <unk> [MASK] is found in many primitive <unk> , and is not unique to one group of <unk> . [MASK] , the [MASK] between <unk> and <unk> vertebrae is not [MASK] clear . Some <unk> have <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> [MASK] at different points in the same <unk> column . Other taxa have [MASK] morphologies that do not fit into any category . <unk> is no longer [MASK] as a group , but <unk> is still [MASK] valid . Below is a [MASK] taxonomy of <unk> showing currently [MASK] groups : Class <unk> Order <unk> <unk> <unk> Family <unk> ( <unk> ) [MASK] <unk> Family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> [MASK] <unk> Family <unk> Family <unk> Family <unk> <unk> <unk> [MASK] <unk> Family <unk> Family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> [MASK] <unk> Family <unk> Family <unk> ( [MASK] is uncertain ) Family <unk> <unk> <unk> Family <unk> [MASK] <unk> Family <unk> Family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) [MASK] <unk> Family <unk> Family <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> = = = [MASK] = = = In one of the earliest [MASK] analyses of the group , <unk> ( 1983 ) recognized five [MASK] that made <unk> a [MASK] : a bone at the back of the skull , the <unk> , is [MASK] to another bone on the [MASK] of the skull , the <unk> ; large [MASK] called <unk> <unk> are present between the <unk> ; the <unk> ( a bone [MASK] in hearing ) is [MASK] to the <unk> and projects upward ; the <unk> , a bone in the [MASK] <unk> , is thin ; and part of the <unk> [MASK] the <unk> <unk> to the neural arch . [MASK] features were given by Godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , [MASK] the [MASK] between the <unk> and <unk> at the back of the skull , small [MASK] ( <unk> processes ) on the ribs , and a [MASK] <unk> with each side having a single <unk> blade . These shared [MASK] are [MASK] <unk> . <unk> are placed as basal <unk> in [MASK] analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . Depending on the [MASK] of modern amphibians , they are either [MASK] in the crown group <unk> or the stem of [MASK] . Crown @-@ group <unk> are [MASK] of the most recent common ancestor of all living <unk> and stem <unk> are forms that are [MASK] the crown group . Modern [MASK] have recently been suggested as [MASK] of <unk> , which would place them within crown <unk> . Below is a [MASK] from <unk> et al . ( 2003 ) [MASK] <unk> within crown <unk> : Other studies place modern amphibians as the [MASK] of <unk> and place <unk> in a more basal [MASK] within the stem of <unk> . Below is a [MASK] from <unk> and <unk> ( 1999 ) [MASK] <unk> outside crown <unk> : Most phylogenetic analyses of <unk> [MASK] focus on individual [MASK] . One of the first broad @-@ scale studies of <unk> phylogeny was conducted by [MASK] Andrew <unk> in 1990 . A 2007 [MASK] made a " <unk> " of all <unk> families , [MASK] the family @-@ level trees of previous studies . The [MASK] cladogram is modified from [MASK] et al . ( 2007 ) : 1 [MASK] , 2 <unk> , 3 <unk> , 4 <unk> , 5 [MASK] , 6 <unk> , 7 <unk> , 8 [MASK] , 9 <unk> , 10 <unk> , 11 [MASK] , 12 <unk> , 13 <unk> , 14 <unk> The most basal group of <unk> is the [MASK] <unk> . <unk> have several [MASK] or <unk> features , including a [MASK] <unk> <unk> and a bone called the <unk> that is absent in other <unk> . <unk> [MASK] the Late <unk> genus <unk> and the [MASK] <unk> . <unk> has also been [MASK] in <unk> , and is the [MASK] known <unk> family . <unk> <unk> is the oldest [MASK] , having been present over 330 million years ago [MASK] the <unk> stage of the Early <unk> . Recent [MASK] place <unk> outside <unk> in a more derived position . Other [MASK] <unk> include <unk> and <unk> . <unk> and <unk> , both [MASK] in 2005 from <unk> , are also [MASK] yet come from the Late <unk> . They are almost 40 [MASK] years younger than other basal <unk> , [MASK] a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the [MASK] record . In 2000 , [MASK] Adam <unk> and Anne Warren produced a revised [MASK] of more derived <unk> , naming several new [MASK] . Two major clades were <unk> and <unk> . <unk> [MASK] the <unk> that were once called <unk> and includes two [MASK] , the <unk> and the <unk> . <unk> include small , mostly [MASK] <unk> that may be the ancestors of modern [MASK] . <unk> include larger <unk> like <unk> . The [MASK] major clade , <unk> , [MASK] most <unk> <unk> , as well as some <unk> groups . Within <unk> are the [MASK] <unk> and the most [MASK] <unk> , the <unk> . <unk> and Warren also named <unk> , a clade of small [MASK] <unk> from the [MASK] , <unk> , and <unk> . They placed <unk> within <unk> , but more recent studies [MASK] on their [MASK] . For example , a 2007 study [MASK] them even more basal than <unk> , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal <unk> . [MASK] <unk> , <unk> and Warren [MASK] two major clades : <unk> and <unk> . <unk> [MASK] large <unk> <unk> like <unk> with flat [MASK] and eyes near the back of the skull . <unk> include a [MASK] of <unk> , including large marine <unk> , aquatic <unk> , <unk> that [MASK] into the [MASK] , and <unk> with eyes near the front of their heads . In 2000 , [MASK] <unk> <unk> and [MASK] <unk> named a third major clade of <unk> , the <unk> . This group included more [MASK] <unk> that could not be [MASK] in either <unk> or <unk> , and [MASK] groups like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . While <unk> and <unk> are still [MASK] used , <unk> is not often [MASK] as a true clade in recent [MASK] . <unk> and <unk> are now grouped with <unk> , but <unk> are still [MASK] to be a [MASK] family of <unk> . A new phylogeny of <unk> was offered by [MASK] <unk> <unk> in 2013 . It [MASK] many of the clades that were found by <unk> and [MASK] , but it did not find support for their [MASK] of derived <unk> into <unk> and <unk> . <unk> were found to be more [MASK] related to <unk> than to <unk> , which were [MASK] with <unk> . The clade [MASK] <unk> and <unk> was named <unk> . In addition , <unk> named the clade [MASK] all <unk> except <unk> <unk> and [MASK] the name <unk> for the clade [MASK] all <unk> except <unk> and <unk> . Below is the [MASK] from <unk> 's analysis : = = = [MASK] to modern amphibians = = = Modern [MASK] ( frogs , <unk> , and <unk> ) are [MASK] in <unk> . <unk> appear to have arisen in the <unk> . [MASK] clock estimates place the first <unk> in the Late <unk> , but the first [MASK] of [MASK] ( frogs and <unk> , but not <unk> ) is [MASK] to have appeared in the Middle <unk> using the same [MASK] . Using fossil evidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern [MASK] . One is that they [MASK] from <unk> <unk> . [MASK] is that they evolved from <unk> , most likely the <unk> . A third [MASK] is that <unk> descended from <unk> and frogs and <unk> [MASK] from <unk> . Recently , the theory that <unk> were the [MASK] of all <unk> has gained wide support . The skull [MASK] of some small <unk> has been [MASK] to those of modern frogs and <unk> , but the [MASK] of <unk> , <unk> teeth in small , <unk> or [MASK] <unk> has been cited as the most [MASK] argument in favor of the <unk> [MASK] of <unk> . <unk> in <unk> and many [MASK] <unk> , <unk> teeth have <unk> tips and bases . During the [MASK] of most <unk> , teeth begin to <unk> at their tips . <unk> [MASK] [MASK] downward to the base of the tooth , but <unk> from the tip stops [MASK] in <unk> teeth . <unk> [MASK] at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth <unk> . This [MASK] is seen in living [MASK] and fossils . The <unk> family <unk> is [MASK] to be most closely related to <unk> . In 2008 , an <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> was named from Texas and was [MASK] the " <unk> " for its frog @-@ like head and [MASK] @-@ like body . It was [MASK] to be the most closely [MASK] <unk> to <unk> and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a [MASK] analysis . Another [MASK] of <unk> called <unk> <unk> is now thought to be even more [MASK] related to <unk> . Unlike <unk> , <unk> was known since 1969 , and the [MASK] of <unk> teeth in its jaws has led some [MASK] to [MASK] soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern [MASK] . It was first described as a " <unk> " , and the [MASK] name <unk> means " connecting " in reference to its inferred [MASK] position between <unk> and <unk> . The [MASK] of its <unk> , a disk @-@ like membrane that [MASK] like an ear drum , is [MASK] to that of frogs and has also been used as [MASK] for a close [MASK] . Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the [MASK] , the short ribs , and the smooth skull [MASK] also point to it being a closer [MASK] of <unk> than is <unk> . Below is a [MASK] modified from <unk> and <unk> ( 2010 ) showing the [MASK] of <unk> , <unk> , and [MASK] : = = <unk> = = = = = Feeding = = = [MASK] the earliest <unk> were [MASK] <unk> , they had the ability to feed on land . [MASK] , <unk> and <unk> , some well adapted to [MASK] life , also fed on land . Some <unk> became better [MASK] toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic [MASK] . The first [MASK] aquatic <unk> were <unk> in the <unk> . <unk> and <unk> became [MASK] aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding . Most aquatic <unk> have [MASK] heads . When feeding , they [MASK] opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of [MASK] their lower jaws . The jaw [MASK] of the <unk> <unk> is well known , and is one of the most highly [MASK] . <unk> is [MASK] to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above [MASK] through the <unk> of the <unk> @-@ <unk> joint [MASK] the <unk> <unk> of the skull and the [MASK] <unk> of the neck . As the skull is raised , the <unk> bone pushes [MASK] and causes the lower jaw to <unk> [MASK] . Other <unk> [MASK] also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such [MASK] . <unk> Watson was the first to [MASK] skull lifting as a means of feeding in <unk> . He [MASK] that <unk> , a much [MASK] <unk> than <unk> , was able to make the same movement . <unk> <unk> <unk> also [MASK] the idea in 1959 , [MASK] that <unk> also fed in this way . At the time it was [MASK] that these <unk> lifted their heads with strong jaw [MASK] , but it is now [MASK] that they used larger muscles in the neck that were [MASK] to the large pectoral <unk> . <unk> , a close [MASK] of <unk> , also has a <unk> [MASK] that muscles may have attached to . [MASK] has very small teeth and a large area for muscle [MASK] behind the skull , suggesting that it could <unk> feed by [MASK] opening its mouth . Unlike <unk> <unk> , [MASK] <unk> have skulls that are [MASK] for biting land @-@ living prey . The <unk> [MASK] the bones of the skull in the <unk> <unk> are able to withstand a high degree of [MASK] . <unk> forces would have been [MASK] when biting down on prey . Earlier aquatic <unk> and <unk> [MASK] differ from <unk> like <unk> in that their [MASK] were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been [MASK] during <unk> feeding [MASK] . <unk> like <unk> were among the first <unk> that were almost [MASK] terrestrial and fed by biting . = = = [MASK] = = = <unk> , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic [MASK] . Most <unk> probably reproduced through external [MASK] . Like most [MASK] frogs , female <unk> would have laid masses of eggs in water while males [MASK] sperm to <unk> them . Several fossils were [MASK] from the Early <unk> of Texas in 1998 that may be egg [MASK] of <unk> <unk> . They were the first known [MASK] of [MASK] eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin [MASK] that are probably <unk> membranes and <unk> @-@ like areas [MASK] them that are most likely <unk> coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , [MASK] that these <unk> laid eggs on [MASK] plants much like modern frogs . The <unk> [MASK] show that the eggs were laid by [MASK] , not fish ( their eggs lack <unk> ) , but the type of [MASK] that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are [MASK] with the eggs . The eggs are [MASK] to be from <unk> because they are likely to be close [MASK] of modern amphibians , and probably had similar [MASK] strategies . They are also the most common [MASK] from the [MASK] in which the eggs were found . One <unk> , the [MASK] <unk> , may have <unk> young in an area [MASK] the gills called the <unk> <unk> . Small bones belonging to younger <unk> [MASK] have been found in these [MASK] . The living Darwin 's Frog is also a mouth <unk> and would be the [MASK] modern [MASK] to <unk> if it cared for its young in this way . An [MASK] possibility is that <unk> was <unk> , eating its young like many [MASK] do today . If this was the case , the [MASK] of these smaller [MASK] were originally located in the throat and were [MASK] into the <unk> <unk> as the animal <unk> . Body impressions of Early <unk> <unk> from [MASK] suggest that some [MASK] <unk> mated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal [MASK] rather than mating in water . The presence of three [MASK] in one block of sandstone shows that the <unk> were [MASK] . The head of one [MASK] rests under the tail of another in what may be a [MASK] display . Internal [MASK] and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern <unk> . = = = [MASK] = = = While most types of <unk> are [MASK] on the basis of features in mature [MASK] , several are known from juvenile and <unk> [MASK] . <unk> is seen in <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , with aquatic larvae [MASK] into adults [MASK] of living on land . Several types of <unk> do not fully <unk> , but retain features of [MASK] such as [MASK] and small body size in what is [MASK] as <unk> . <unk> and the <unk> <unk> were also <unk> because they [MASK] gills , but they are only known from adult [MASK] . <unk> larvae are often [MASK] by poorly developed bones and the presence of a <unk> [MASK] , a series of bones that gills would attach to in life . [MASK] , some fully mature <unk> also possess <unk> bones but did not have [MASK] gills . A dense [MASK] of scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body [MASK] occur in <unk> , including the <unk> and [MASK] of skull bones , the <unk> of <unk> bones , and an [MASK] in body size . [MASK] like <unk> are known from both large adult [MASK] and small larvae , showing an [MASK] change in body shape . In these species , the shape and [MASK] of skull bones change in the early stages of development . The [MASK] on the surface of the skull roof also [MASK] at this time . Small , [MASK] spaced pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . As [MASK] continues , the external gills [MASK] . Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost . The <unk> [MASK] does not [MASK] at the same rate as the skull , with [MASK] ( the replacement of cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly . <unk> and limb bones are poorly [MASK] , ribs and [MASK] are absent in the early stages , and the <unk> and <unk> are [MASK] absent through most of [MASK] . Once maturity is reached , most bones have fully [MASK] and growth rate slows . The bones of some <unk> like <unk> show [MASK] marks , possibly an [MASK] that growth rate varied with the change in [MASK] . <unk> of <unk> like <unk> and <unk> show that [MASK] grew larger past maturity . The oldest [MASK] usually have more <unk> on their skulls with deeper [MASK] . One group of <unk> , the <unk> , is also known from <unk> [MASK] . <unk> like <unk> and <unk> are [MASK] by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . An entire growth series is [MASK] in the wide range of sizes among [MASK] , but the lack of <unk> adapted adult forms [MASK] that these <unk> were <unk> . Unlike other <unk> , their <unk> [MASK] [MASK] quickly but were still partly <unk> when fully mature . Adults likely had an aquatic [MASK] similar to juveniles . Recently , large [MASK] of <unk> <unk> were described with [MASK] toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not all <unk> were <unk> . While most <unk> are [MASK] in early [MASK] of life , most <unk> appear to have been [MASK] in their juvenile stage . Like other <unk> <unk> , adult <unk> were [MASK] to a <unk> [MASK] . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross @-@ <unk> [MASK] of limb bones in adult <unk> shows that they could not [MASK] the stress of [MASK] <unk> . <unk> individuals have bones that are thick enough to [MASK] this stress , and could [MASK] move about on land . To maintain a [MASK] lifestyle , a <unk> 's limb bones would have to <unk> with [MASK] <unk> , meaning that they would grow at a [MASK] rate than the rest of the body . This is not the case in [MASK] , [MASK] that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a [MASK] lifestyle . = = = <unk> = = = <unk> and other early <unk> have [MASK] <unk> <unk> in the back of the skull that [MASK] into the cheek [MASK] . In life , the <unk> notch would have been covered by a [MASK] called the [MASK] , which is seen as a disk @-@ like area in living frogs . The <unk> is [MASK] in [MASK] , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced <unk> . It was [MASK] thought that the <unk> [MASK] very early in <unk> evolution as a hearing organ and [MASK] to form the ear drum of <unk> . Thus , <unk> possessed a hearing system [MASK] ancestral to that of living [MASK] and reptiles . <unk> and all other [MASK] <unk> have a rod @-@ like bone called the <unk> that aids in hearing by [MASK] <unk> from the ear drum — or [MASK] <unk> — to the [MASK] ear . <unk> also have a <unk> , which [MASK] into the <unk> cavity . The <unk> likely [MASK] from the <unk> of lobe @-@ <unk> fishes . The [MASK] of the <unk> and the shape of the <unk> region [MASK] that the <unk> of <unk> and frogs are <unk> , but the <unk> of these [MASK] are no longer [MASK] <unk> with the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear [MASK] in <unk> were not [MASK] to those of all other <unk> . The [MASK] of the <unk> and <unk> to [MASK] transmit <unk> is called <unk> matching . Early <unk> like <unk> have thick <unk> with poor <unk> [MASK] , so it is now [MASK] that they were not used for [MASK] . Instead , these thick <unk> may have [MASK] to support the tissue that covers the <unk> notch . Early <unk> like <unk> could not hear [MASK] sound but would have been able to detect [MASK] in the ground . Later <unk> like <unk> had <unk> [MASK] adapted to hearing . <unk> has a [MASK] in the inner ear [MASK] the <unk> <unk> , which is also seen in frogs and is [MASK] with hearing . Its <unk> is also a better <unk> of sound . The [MASK] system of <unk> and [MASK] <unk> was able to detect airborne sound and may have been [MASK] to that of living [MASK] . = <unk> de Bayeux = <unk> de Bayeux ( <unk> 1121 to <unk> ) was a [MASK] English <unk> and [MASK] in the Diocese of York . A relative of <unk> , the [MASK] of York , <unk> probably owed his [MASK] positions to this relative . After <unk> 's death , <unk> was [MASK] to one of the candidates for the [MASK] , William <unk> , and worked to secure <unk> 's deposition and [MASK] by [MASK] <unk> . After <unk> 's death in <unk> , <unk> tried to [MASK] the return of <unk> , but these attempts were [MASK] . When <unk> died suddenly in 1154 , <unk> was accused of [MASK] the newly returned [MASK] . Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an [MASK] court , he was [MASK] of his clerical status and became a <unk> before <unk> . He died after <unk> , [MASK] even [MASK] 1194 . = = Early life = = <unk> was first mentioned in the [MASK] record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter , which [MASK] likely a forgery , probably contains an [MASK] witness list . This document lists him as " <unk> [MASK] " , which means that he [MASK] held the <unk> of [MASK] . He was the nephew of <unk> , who was [MASK] of York from <unk> to 1140 . <unk> he owed his position as [MASK] to his uncle and was probably [MASK] at a young age . A charter of <unk> 's , [MASK] to around 1138 , names <unk> [MASK] as <unk> 's nephew . = = Opposition to [MASK] <unk> = = <unk> was opposed to the election of William <unk> as [MASK] of York and supported William 's rival and [MASK] Henry <unk> . Although he remained a [MASK] of <unk> after <unk> , he did [MASK] <unk> 's <unk> in <unk> Abbey , where <unk> had deposed one abbot and [MASK] another . In <unk> , <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's choice as abbot of <unk> and appointed another abbot . [MASK] , <unk> had supported Elias <unk> , <unk> 's [MASK] for abbot , but then changed his stance and helped with the [MASK] . After <unk> 's death in <unk> , <unk> was [MASK] to William 's return as archbishop , but was [MASK] in his [MASK] to prevent William 's <unk> . William died a week after his return to York , [MASK] , and <unk> , along with [MASK] of <unk> , the Dean of York , secured the quick [MASK] of the new [MASK] , Roger de <unk> L <unk> . = = <unk> [MASK] = = <unk> was accused of murdering William , [MASK] by poisoning him through the communion <unk> . A [MASK] <unk> , <unk> , who had been a <unk> of the deceased [MASK] , brought murder charges against <unk> . <unk> [MASK] a hearing on the charges at a royal council [MASK] over by King Stephen of [MASK] at <unk> in 1154 , but Stephen 's [MASK] death prevented a resolution . <unk> attempted to have the trial switched to an [MASK] court and was supported in his efforts by [MASK] Theobald of Canterbury . A trial was [MASK] held in <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> did not produce any [MASK] , but <unk> was unable to prove his [MASK] , prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court . No [MASK] of any judgment exists , but <unk> [MASK] appeared before two <unk> , Adrian IV and [MASK] III . A further appeal to the papal court was [MASK] to papal judges @-@ delegate between 1175 and 1180 . The case attracted [MASK] by two [MASK] writers . John of Salisbury , who was a secretary for Theobald , added [MASK] about <unk> in a letter to [MASK] III on unrelated business . In the [MASK] of the letter , John pointed out to the pope that no [MASK] what others might say about <unk> , he had [MASK] to secure other clergy willing to <unk> that he was innocent . Another [MASK] , Gilbert Foliot , who was Bishop of [MASK] , wrote to the pope to remind him that [MASK] <unk> 's <unk> had offered to prove his [MASK] by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was [MASK] meaningless since canon law [MASK] the clergy from the ordeal . = = [MASK] life and death = = <unk> was no longer [MASK] by <unk> , as his successor is attested by that point . <unk> , however , [MASK] to call himself " [MASK] " even though he held land as a secular lord , [MASK] lands in Lacy and <unk> . He also acted as a [MASK] for Hugh de [MASK] . <unk> was still alive in <unk> , as he was a witness to a [MASK] at York then , and may have been [MASK] as late as 1194 , when Hugh <unk> was [MASK] for the farm of <unk> 's lands , as the [MASK] of that [MASK] in the <unk> roll is unclear if <unk> was [MASK] at that time or dead . <unk> had two sons , [MASK] de Bayeux and <unk> de <unk> . <unk> was a benefactor to a number of [MASK] , [MASK] Drax Priory , <unk> Priory and <unk> Priory . He also gave land to a [MASK] in York and to the Templars and [MASK] . = Dvorak technique = The Dvorak [MASK] ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely used system to [MASK] tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes tropical [MASK] , tropical storm , and [MASK] / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone <unk> ) based solely on visible and infrared [MASK] images . Within the Dvorak [MASK] strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual [MASK] that a cyclone may take on which [MASK] the upper and lower bounds on its [MASK] . The primary patterns used are curved band [MASK] ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , shear pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , [MASK] dense <unk> ( <unk> ) [MASK] ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central cold cover ( <unk> ) [MASK] , banding eye pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , and eye [MASK] ( <unk> - <unk> ) . Both the [MASK] dense <unk> and [MASK] eye pattern use the size of the <unk> . The <unk> pattern <unk> start at <unk> , [MASK] to minimal tropical storm [MASK] ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . The shape of the [MASK] dense <unk> is also [MASK] . The eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the [MASK] mass of [MASK] and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the [MASK] difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Once a pattern is [MASK] , the storm [MASK] ( such as length and <unk> of banding [MASK] ) are further analyzed to arrive at a [MASK] T @-@ number . The <unk> pattern indicates little [MASK] is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops [MASK] with the quickly evolving feature . Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their [MASK] , [MASK] the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and <unk> [MASK] ( <unk> ) , the <unk> / <unk> <unk> [MASK] Branch ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval [MASK] and <unk> Command in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . = = [MASK] of the method = = The initial [MASK] of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak , using [MASK] pictures of tropical cyclones within the [MASK] Pacific ocean . The system as it was [MASK] conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a [MASK] and decay model . As the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s , [MASK] of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone [MASK] and central [MASK] of the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area . Use of infrared [MASK] imagery led to a more objective [MASK] of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top [MASK] within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm [MASK] within the eye itself . <unk> on short term [MASK] change are used less [MASK] than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s . The central [MASK] assigned to tropical cyclones have required [MASK] , as the original estimates were 5 @-@ 10 [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 15 @-@ 0 @.@ 29 inHg ) too low in the [MASK] and up to 20 hPa ( 0 @.@ 59 [MASK] ) too high in the northwest Pacific . This led to the [MASK] of a separate wind @-@ pressure [MASK] for the northwest Pacific , devised by [MASK] and Holliday in 1975 , then [MASK] in 1977 . As human analysts using the [MASK] lead to <unk> biases , efforts have been made to make more [MASK] estimates using computer programs , which have been aided by higher @-@ [MASK] satellite imagery and more powerful [MASK] . Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can <unk> over time , automated [MASK] use a six @-@ hour [MASK] period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates . [MASK] of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which [MASK] best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of [MASK] or typhoon strength ) . It still required a manual center [MASK] , keeping some <unk> within the process . By 2004 , an advanced [MASK] Dvorak [MASK] was developed which utilized banding features for systems below [MASK] intensity and to <unk> determine the tropical cyclone 's center . A central pressure bias was [MASK] in 2004 [MASK] to the slope of the <unk> and cloud top [MASK] which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure [MASK] within the objective technique . = = Details of the method = = In a [MASK] cyclone , the [MASK] takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain [MASK] features , and as they [MASK] , they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner . The structure and [MASK] of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to [MASK] if the storm has weakened , [MASK] its intensity , or [MASK] . Various central cloud and banding features are compared with <unk> that show typical storm patterns and their [MASK] [MASK] . If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the [MASK] utilizes the difference between the [MASK] of the warm eye and the [MASK] cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops [MASK] indicate a more intense storm ) . In each case a " T @-@ [MASK] " ( an [MASK] for Tropical Number ) and a Current <unk> ( <unk> ) value are [MASK] to the storm . These [MASK] range between 1 ( minimum intensity ) and 8 ( maximum [MASK] ) . The T @-@ number and <unk> value are the same except for [MASK] [MASK] , in which case the <unk> is higher . For [MASK] systems , the <unk> is held as the tropical cyclone [MASK] for 12 hours , though research from the National [MASK] Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable . The table at right shows the [MASK] surface wind speed and sea level pressure that [MASK] to a given T @-@ number . The amount a [MASK] cyclone can change in [MASK] per 24 ‑ hour period is [MASK] to 2 @.@ 5 T @-@ numbers per day . = = = [MASK] types = = = Within the Dvorak [MASK] strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual [MASK] that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its [MASK] . The primary [MASK] used are curved band pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , shear [MASK] ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , [MASK] dense <unk> ( <unk> ) pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , [MASK] eye pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , eye [MASK] ( <unk> - <unk> ) , and [MASK] cold cover ( <unk> ) pattern . Both the central dense <unk> and [MASK] eye [MASK] utilize the size of the <unk> . The <unk> pattern <unk> start at <unk> , [MASK] to minimal tropical storm [MASK] ( 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) ) . The shape of the [MASK] dense <unk> is also [MASK] . The farther the center is <unk> into the <unk> , the [MASK] it is deemed . Tropical cyclones with maximum [MASK] winds between 65 [MASK] per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 [MASK] per hour ( 160 km / h ) can have their center of <unk> obscured by [MASK] within visible and infrared [MASK] imagery , which makes diagnosis of their [MASK] a challenge . The <unk> pattern , with its large and quickly [MASK] mass of thick <unk> clouds spreading out from an area of [MASK] near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , [MASK] little [MASK] . When it develops , rainbands and cloud lines around the [MASK] cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield <unk> the [MASK] center . While it resembles a <unk> [MASK] , it is rarely seen . The eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the [MASK] mass of [MASK] and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the [MASK] difference is , the [MASK] the tropical cyclone . Winds within tropical cyclones can also be [MASK] by tracking features within the <unk> using rapid scan <unk> [MASK] imagery , whose pictures are taken [MASK] apart rather than every half @-@ hour . Once a pattern is [MASK] , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> of banding [MASK] ) are further analyzed to arrive at a [MASK] T @-@ number . = = Usage = = Several [MASK] issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their [MASK] . These include the National [MASK] Center 's Tropical Analysis and <unk> Branch ( <unk> ) , the [MASK] <unk> and <unk> [MASK] 's <unk> Analysis Branch ( <unk> ) , and the Joint [MASK] Warning Center at the Naval Pacific [MASK] and <unk> Center in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . The National [MASK] Center will often quote Dvorak T @-@ numbers in their tropical cyclone products . The [MASK] example is from [MASK] number 3 of Tropical Depression 24 ( [MASK] Hurricane <unk> ) of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season : [MASK] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> IN <unk> A <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / 35 <unk> . <unk> ...

Note that in this case the [MASK] T @-@ number ( in this case <unk> ) was [MASK] used as a guide but other factors [MASK] how the NHC decided to set the system 's intensity . The Cooperative Institute for [MASK] <unk> Studies ( <unk> ) at the [MASK] of Wisconsin – Madison has [MASK] the <unk> Dvorak <unk> ( <unk> ) . This is a [MASK] version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than <unk> human [MASK] to arrive at a <unk> number . This is [MASK] not [MASK] for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . The China [MASK] Agency ( <unk> ) is expected to start using the [MASK] 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Indian [MASK] Department ( <unk> ) prefers using visible [MASK] imagery over infrared imagery due to a [MASK] high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of [MASK] maximum . The Japan [MASK] Agency ( JMA ) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the [MASK] imagery version . Hong Kong [MASK] and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone [MASK] . Various centers hold on to the maximum current [MASK] for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid [MASK] is obvious .

Its overall [MASK] has not always been true , as <unk> in the [MASK] led to [MASK] changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 [MASK] per hour ( 32 km / h ) . The method is [MASK] consistent in that it <unk> rapid [MASK] or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some [MASK] cyclones <unk> in strength more than the 2 @.@ 5 T [MASK] per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique 's [MASK] and has led to occasional [MASK] of the constraints since the 1980s .

Their work , which used <unk> paints to create designs [MASK] body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous [MASK] of central Australia , [MASK] after the introduction of a government @-@ sanctioned art program in central [MASK] in 1983 . By the 1980s and ' 90s , such work was being [MASK] [MASK] . The first artists , including all of the [MASK] of the <unk> <unk> artists ' company , were men , and there was [MASK] among the <unk> men of central [MASK] to women also painting . However , many of the women wished to [MASK] , and in the [MASK] many of them began to paint . In the western desert [MASK] such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on the <unk> , [MASK] were beginning to create art works <unk> for [MASK] and sale . = = = [MASK] = = = <unk> <unk> began [MASK] about 1990 or 1992 as part of the [MASK] Indigenous art movement that had begun at <unk> in the [MASK] . By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public [MASK] , such as Charles Sturt [MASK] , and in 2005 a work was [MASK] by the National Gallery of Victoria . Her career received a [MASK] boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria 's 2006 Landmarks [MASK] and its [MASK] ; her painting was printed opposite that of <unk> Tommy [MASK] , who was by this time famous , [MASK] for his contribution to the design of a new [MASK] for the Musée du <unk> <unk> . <unk> 's paintings have been included at [MASK] in several private [MASK] in Melbourne and Hong Kong , as well as at the [MASK] embassy in Washington in 2001 . In 2006 a [MASK] work by <unk> was exhibited at <unk> College at the [MASK] of New South Wales as part of a charity [MASK] exhibition . It sold for A $ 22 [MASK] 000 .

An [MASK] based on a <unk> by <unk> , Bush <unk> , [MASK] on the cover of a book on the visual [MASK] of motion , Motion Vision . Central [MASK] artists frequently paint particular " <unk> " , or [MASK] , for which they have [MASK] or rights . These stories are used to pass " [MASK] knowledge , cultural values and belief systems " from [MASK] to generation . <unk> by <unk> portray two [MASK] groups of <unk> , rendered in two distinct styles . Bush plum dreaming [MASK] a plant of the central [MASK] desert which is " a source of physical and spiritual [MASK] , reminding [ the local Indigenous people ] of the <unk> of [ their ] [MASK] " . These paintings are [MASK] with red , blue and orange dots that [MASK] the fruit at different stages in its [MASK] . She also paints women ’ s ceremonies ( <unk> ) and <unk> , and these are [MASK] using rows of coloured dots and include [MASK] of women 's ceremonial [MASK] . Journalist <unk> <unk> described <unk> as one of the " finest [MASK] Aboriginal artists " . Art [MASK] Adrian Newstead has ranked her as amongst the country 's top 200 [MASK] artists , noting that she has become " known for [MASK] works that create a sense of visual [MASK] through fine <unk> fields of <unk> applied <unk> " . Her style is described by [MASK] art writers <unk> and <unk> as an " [MASK] , modern [MASK] of landscape " . <unk> 's work is held in a variety of public and private [MASK] , including <unk> , the Charles Sturt [MASK] Collection , the Holmes a Court [MASK] , and the National Gallery of [MASK] . = Head VI = Head VI is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas [MASK] by the Irish @-@ born [MASK] <unk> artist Francis <unk> , the last of six [MASK] making up his " 1949 Head " series . It shows a bust view of a [MASK] figure , modeled on Diego <unk> 's [MASK] of Innocent X. <unk> applies forceful , [MASK] brush <unk> , and places the figure within a glass cage [MASK] , behind curtain @-@ like <unk> . This gives the [MASK] of a man trapped and <unk> by his [MASK] , screaming into an [MASK] void . Head VI was the first of <unk> 's [MASK] to reference <unk> , whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him [MASK] his career and inspired his series of " [MASK] <unk> " , a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving [MASK] works . Head VI [MASK] many motifs that were to reappear in <unk> 's work . The [MASK] object , which may be a light switch or [MASK] <unk> , can be found even in his late [MASK] . The <unk> cage is a motif that [MASK] as late as his 1985 – 86 [MASK] , Study for a Self @-@ Portrait — <unk> . Head VI was first [MASK] in [MASK] 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London , in a showing [MASK] by one of the artist 's early [MASK] , Erica <unk> . At the time , <unk> was a highly [MASK] but respected artist , best known for his 1944 Three [MASK] for Figures at the Base of a <unk> , which made him the <unk> [MASK] of British art . Head VI drew a mixed [MASK] from art [MASK] ; John Russell , later <unk> 's [MASK] , at the time dismissed it as a cross [MASK] " an <unk> <unk> of its jaws and an [MASK] in <unk> @-@ <unk> who has come to a bad end " . In 1989 [MASK] <unk> wrote that the " shock of the [MASK] , when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was [MASK] . It was everything <unk> . The [MASK] appearance at once of [MASK] and <unk> was indeed one of <unk> 's most [MASK] <unk> . " Art critic and curator David [MASK] described it as a seminal piece from <unk> 's unusually [MASK] 1949 – 50 period , and one of <unk> 's [MASK] <unk> . = = 1949 Head series = = <unk> 's output is [MASK] by sequences of images . He told Sylvester that his [MASK] was [MASK] by sequences and that " images breed other images in me " . His series were not always [MASK] or painted in sequence ; [MASK] paintings are grouped for [MASK] but vary in execution and tone . The idea for the head series came after he [MASK] <unk> , late in 1948 , from a stay in [MASK] . In the [MASK] three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last [MASK] canvas from this period is his [MASK] ( 1946 ) . Although he [MASK] to paint , he was a ruthless self critic , [MASK] to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and no works [MASK] from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 . <unk> Erica <unk> offered <unk> the [MASK] of a solo show for the [MASK] of her new Hanover Gallery . He agreed , but had [MASK] in reserve to hang . In [MASK] years , <unk> became perhaps the most [MASK] of <unk> 's early champions ; she arranged this showing — his debut solo [MASK] — publicised him widely and organised <unk> for [MASK] <unk> . Already 40 years old , <unk> viewed the [MASK] as his last chance and applied himself to the task with [MASK] . Because he had [MASK] all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to [MASK] new [MASK] . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but [MASK] found themes that [MASK] him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five [MASK] stronger variants in the final weeks before the November [MASK] , completing the series barely in time for the opening . The [MASK] depict [MASK] figures enclosed in spaces that are <unk> , [MASK] <unk> , <unk> and eerie . Coming early in <unk> 's career , they are uneven in [MASK] , but show a clear [MASK] especially in how they <unk> and present ideas he was still clearly [MASK] and coming to terms with . Head I ( [MASK] begun in the [MASK] of 1948 ) and Head II show <unk> pieces of flesh that broadly [MASK] human heads ; they have half @-@ open eyes and a <unk> , [MASK] it is [MASK] much higher than would be expected in a [MASK] . Heads III , IV and V show fully formed <unk> recognisable as men , and are [MASK] by a haunted [MASK] . These two broad ideas <unk> in Head VI , which is as <unk> [MASK] as the first two [MASK] , and as spectral as the middle three . In Head VI the figure has [MASK] and is now shown wearing vestments , the first [MASK] in <unk> 's work of the [MASK] of <unk> , while the focus has [MASK] the open mouth and the study of the human [MASK] . <unk> said that chance played a [MASK] role in his work , and that he often [MASK] a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was [MASK] the case in the mid to late 1940s , a [MASK] when he was [MASK] heavily and spending most nights in <unk> <unk> and poker rooms . The [MASK] morning he would often [MASK] his canvas " in a bad mood of drinking ... under [MASK] <unk> and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . " He [MASK] his [MASK] for chance into his work : an image often would <unk> mid @-@ way through into [MASK] quite [MASK] from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this [MASK] and felt it crucial to his [MASK] as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were [MASK] ; he said that " perhaps the drink [MASK] me to be a bit <unk> . " This is very [MASK] in the 1949 series , which began as a rather <unk> study of a [MASK] head , but evolved over the six [MASK] panels into a reworking of <unk> [MASK] , and arrived at an image that was to <unk> <unk> for the [MASK] 20 years . The series marks <unk> 's first attempt at [MASK] lone [MASK] in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it [MASK] that the subject felt isolated , <unk> , and had [MASK] the need to present an outward face . He believed that under these [MASK] all <unk> falls away , and the social being [MASK] the sum of its <unk> , which <unk> [MASK] to convey by [MASK] the subject to its bare @-@ bones [MASK] : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . [MASK] to Russell , " the view out front [MASK] to be the only one , and our person is suddenly <unk> , [MASK] , and subject to strange <unk> . " Russell observed that while the [MASK] of [MASK] in rooms is common through all eras of [MASK] , the figures are always posed , and usually [MASK] aware that they are being portrayed . This <unk> is [MASK] in <unk> 's series . Head I , completed late in 1948 , is [MASK] more successful than Head II . Although it is well @-@ regarded [MASK] , Head II is seen as [MASK] of a creative [MASK] @-@ de @-@ sac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered as merely [MASK] steps towards Head VI . It is [MASK] in <unk> 's <unk> that works of their [MASK] poor quality survive ; he was <unk> self @-@ [MASK] and often <unk> or [MASK] <unk> before they were completed . When pressed again by <unk> in 1953 to [MASK] works for a New York show that she had been [MASK] for a year , he was full of doubt and [MASK] most of what he had been working on , [MASK] several other <unk> . <unk> [MASK] another showing to be held in 1950 , for which <unk> painted three large <unk> [MASK] on <unk> 's portrait . The gallery [MASK] the show as " Francis <unk> : Three Studies from the [MASK] of [MASK] X by <unk> " , but in the end <unk> was [MASK] with the works and destroyed them before the show opened . = = [MASK] = = The figure is clearly [MASK] as a pope from his [MASK] . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ [MASK] glass cage . This framing device , [MASK] by Sylvester as a " space @-@ frame " , was to feature heavily [MASK] the [MASK] 's career . A <unk> hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , [MASK] just in front of the pope 's face and [MASK] covering his eyes . It is too <unk> drawn to identify with [MASK] , but given the [MASK] of similar objects in <unk> 's later works , may be [MASK] the end of a [MASK] light switch or the <unk> of a curtain ; the hanging <unk> was to become a [MASK] for the artist . Apart from its [MASK] meaning , it has a <unk> [MASK] , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object [MASK] most [MASK] in the centre panel of his 1973 <unk> , May – June 1973 , where it is [MASK] a [MASK] light bulb . For <unk> , these elements were [MASK] to make the figure <unk> in and out of sight for the viewer , [MASK] to the fact that [MASK] can be on or off , <unk> open or [MASK] . The figure 's mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an [MASK] <unk> took from a still he kept of the nurse [MASK] in <unk> <unk> 's Odessa Steps [MASK] sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship <unk> . In 1984 , the [MASK] <unk> Bragg asked <unk> about the still , and [MASK] that in his earlier career the artist seemed [MASK] with the <unk> of the human mouth . <unk> [MASK] , " I had always [MASK] that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a <unk> [MASK] though I never [MASK] in doing so . " When Bragg asked why he [MASK] he had failed , <unk> said , " It [MASK] be all much more colour , should have got more of the [MASK] of the mouth , with all the colours of the [MASK] of the mouth , but I didn 't [MASK] to get it . " His [MASK] in the mouth was further [MASK] by a medical textbook of <unk> oral cavities bought in a [MASK] @-@ hand <unk> , kept in his studio and to which he often [MASK] to . The glass cage might imply a [MASK] that the figure 's voice is [MASK] to escape ; as if it is [MASK] in silence . <unk> later in life , <unk> said that he had " [MASK] to paint the scream more than the [MASK] . I think , if I had really thought about what causes [MASK] to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more [MASK] " . The work evokes [MASK] of the Second World War . The glass [MASK] of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as <unk> [MASK] of Adolf <unk> 1961 trial before a [MASK] District Court , when he was held within a [MASK] cage . <unk> strongly resisted literal [MASK] though , and stated that he used the [MASK] so he could frame and " really see the image – for no other [MASK] . I know it 's been [MASK] as being many other things . " Other critics saw [MASK] between the glass case and the radio <unk> of late 1930s [MASK] who warned against the [MASK] <unk> . Denis Farr notes that <unk> was [MASK] to George Orwell and referred in interviews to <unk> " shouting voices ... and [MASK] hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh [MASK] of an <unk> . " = = [MASK] = = The so @-@ called " space frame " had [MASK] been used by Alberto <unk> in the 1930s , and the two [MASK] became [MASK] in the 1960s . However <unk> had by 1949 used it only in <unk> [MASK] before <unk> 's <unk> , and in turn [MASK] his use in " The Cage " of 1950 . A similar two [MASK] construct is found in Henry Moore 's works , [MASK] his " <unk> for King and Queen " , [MASK] three years after <unk> 's Head . It is [MASK] to <unk> how these artists [MASK] and informed each other . What is notable is that <unk> [MASK] to use the motif , with [MASK] until the end of his life . [MASK] suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three [MASK] of the Male Back . The full @-@ length golden [MASK] @-@ like folds painted in heavy brush <unk> are in part [MASK] by <unk> but also similar to <unk> 's 1558 [MASK] of Cardinal Filippo <unk> . <unk> <unk> the Old Master 's device to isolate and [MASK] the [MASK] from the viewer ; the black ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds , making the [MASK] all the more [MASK] . <unk> had already used similar forms in his [MASK] panel , and they were to become a feature of his most [MASK] 1950s works , [MASK] in his " screaming <unk> " . He became [MASK] with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting , and collected many [MASK] of works by <unk> and <unk> in which it is [MASK] . He had begun his career as an [MASK] <unk> and designer of [MASK] and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s , and [MASK] said that he liked " rooms hung all round with just [MASK] hung in even folds " . <unk> or <unk> appear in <unk> 's [MASK] works , notably the 1949 Study from the Human Body , [MASK] in [MASK] and always in front of , rather than behind , the figure . Head VI is closely [MASK] on <unk> 's c . 1650 [MASK] of Innocent X , today in the <unk> <unk> [MASK] , Rome . <unk> [MASK] avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics [MASK] he was afraid of being [MASK] , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his [MASK] . Yet his [MASK] was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced [MASK] of it <unk> for almost two decades ; an [MASK] and homage described as " without parallel in the history of art " . <unk> 's [MASK] differs to <unk> 's in a number of ways : both [MASK] were [MASK] , yet <unk> 's broad brush @-@ <unk> and freedom with paint [MASK] with <unk> 's tight and controlled treatment . He <unk> <unk> 's [MASK] of the pope to place him above the [MASK] 's point of view , [MASK] and <unk> him . This was already a common technique in commercial , [MASK] photography but in <unk> 's hands , <unk> [MASK] , the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the [MASK] to <unk> observe . [MASK] <unk> revered <unk> 's portrait , he did not try and [MASK] the earlier painting . In [MASK] , he said that he saw flaws in <unk> 's work and that he [MASK] that social [MASK] and order as , according to art historian <unk> <unk> , " [MASK] and decayed " . <unk> 's [MASK] was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again , [MASK] making a <unk> comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and [MASK] painting . Yet <unk> 's [MASK] is apparent in many aspects of the [MASK] . The sitter 's pose closely echoes the [MASK] , as does the violet and white [MASK] of his cope , which is built up through broad , thick , brush @-@ <unk> . The [MASK] can be further seen in the gold @-@ coloured [MASK] on the back of the seat that [MASK] on both sides of the figure . Art [MASK] <unk> <unk> describes the work as a mixture of <unk> and [MASK] that pays [MASK] to <unk> , while at the same time <unk> his painting . [MASK] <unk> the influence of late works by <unk> in other aspects , [MASK] in the deep and rich colouring , <unk> 's [MASK] of Philip IV , and agrees with [MASK] of <unk> of Edgar <unk> as a source . He [MASK] <unk> borrowed from <unk> the use of [MASK] heavy folds to create the illusion of what <unk> [MASK] as " <unk> " , as seen in the [MASK] artist 's After the Bath , Woman drying herself . [MASK] makes a further direct link between the folds and the [MASK] veil in <unk> 's [MASK] of Cardinal Filippo <unk> . He believes the folds serve to " push the [MASK] back " , [MASK] a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the [MASK] between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely [MASK] the bars of a prison . [MASK] describes them as an <unk> of [MASK] <unk> into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass [MASK] the sitter . In his " <unk> with [MASK] <unk> " series of books , he asked <unk> why he found the [MASK] so [MASK] . The artist replied , " Well , it means that the [MASK] doesn 't come straight out at you but <unk> slowly and gently [MASK] the gaps . " When asked why he was [MASK] to revisit the <unk> so often , <unk> [MASK] that he had [MASK] against <unk> per <unk> , but merely sought " an excuse to use these [MASK] , and you can 't give [MASK] clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false <unk> [MASK] . " <unk> sees Head VI as a [MASK] against <unk> , and a [MASK] on how the papacy is " obsolete and decayed " , with a pope resistant to both [MASK] and <unk> . To him , the [MASK] seems to " [MASK] the <unk> of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the [MASK] work order . He screams and <unk> , [MASK] at arms of his throne . " [MASK] notes that <unk> was impressed by Picasso 's <unk> and handling of paint , [MASK] in Picasso 's 1930s works ; and [MASK] that the white <unk> around the pope 's <unk> may be [MASK] by the 1913 [MASK] in a <unk> <unk> in an <unk> . = = Critical [MASK] = = When <unk> undertook the series late in 1948 he was [MASK] of a two @-@ hit wonder . He had [MASK] in 1944 with Three [MASK] for Figures at the Base of a <unk> and to a lesser extent with [MASK] ( 1946 ) , both of which were highly [MASK] but viewed as <unk> . The [MASK] was a success , and marked his critical [MASK] . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only [MASK] <unk> . The full show [MASK] him in the minds of critics as , [MASK] to Michael <unk> , " more of a force to be <unk> with in the [MASK] scene " . While some found his [MASK] <unk> and <unk> , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his [MASK] as the <unk> [MASK] of post @-@ war British art . The critic for The [MASK] wrote , " The recent [MASK] ... <unk> as they are , cannot be ignored . [MASK] they are superb , and the masterly [MASK] of large areas of <unk> grey , flushed with a [MASK] pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the [MASK] 's gift should have been brought to [MASK] so esoteric " . Most critics focused on Heads I and VI , remarking [MASK] on the [MASK] between the two . While some found the inherent violence of the [MASK] <unk> , <unk> was a skilled [MASK] and turned the bad press into notoriety , and brought <unk> 's work to national [MASK] . <unk> notes that the [MASK] showed <unk> no longer needed <unk> material to make an impact , and was now [MASK] of creating an intense [MASK] response through more subtle means , and had found a way of [MASK] the human condition in the way he had sought , by [MASK] his sitter " in a <unk> [MASK] , a cage or [ [MASK] ] a parted <unk> ... the rest , the most essential , lay in the [MASK] of the [MASK] <unk> medium of oil paint " . After the showing <unk> [MASK] became " less the <unk> with an [MASK] image of <unk> <unk> and more a force to be <unk> with on the [MASK] scene " . His reputation and the value of his panels rose [MASK] , and after the showing he was sought after by [MASK] , American and African [MASK] and galleries , commanding prices as high as £ 400 for single works , [MASK] for a [MASK] British artist of the time . = = <unk> = = Head VI was first [MASK] at the [MASK] Gallery , London , in 1949 . It was [MASK] by the Arts Council 's <unk> Gallery in 1952 . The <unk> has [MASK] it out a number of times since , [MASK] for major <unk> at the [MASK] <unk> , Paris in 1971 , and the Hugh Lane [MASK] , Dublin , in 2000 . In May 1996 , the [MASK] Gallery took on loan <unk> 's Innocent X portrait and hung it [MASK] four <unk> paintings ; [MASK] VI , Pope I ( 1951 ) , Pope 1961 and Pope 1965 . <unk> [MASK] that <unk> would have [MASK] of such a showing with a work he [MASK] one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , [MASK] Head VI , " stood up to it , and even enhanced its [MASK] as one of the most [MASK] studies of human nature and [MASK] power " . = <unk> = <unk> was a [MASK] in early 20th @-@ century Anglo @-@ American poetry that favored [MASK] of imagery and clear , sharp language . <unk> has been described as the most [MASK] movement in English poetry since the [MASK] of the Pre @-@ <unk> . As a [MASK] style it gave <unk> its start in the early 20th century , and is [MASK] to be the first [MASK] <unk> literary movement in the English language . <unk> is [MASK] viewed as ' a [MASK] of creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period of [MASK] . René <unk> remarked that ' It is more [MASK] to consider <unk> not as a [MASK] , nor even as a poetic school , but as the [MASK] of a few poets who were for a certain time in [MASK] on a small number of important [MASK] ' . The <unk> rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical of much Romantic and [MASK] poetry , in contrast to their [MASK] , the Georgian poets , who were [MASK] content to work within that tradition . In [MASK] , <unk> called for a return to what were seen as more [MASK] values , such as <unk> of [MASK] and economy of language , as well as a [MASK] to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms . <unk> use free verse . <unk> [MASK] appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most [MASK] [MASK] figures , both in poetry and in other fields . The <unk> group was [MASK] in London , with [MASK] from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States . <unk> [MASK] for the time , a number of women writers were major <unk> figures . A [MASK] feature of <unk> is its [MASK] to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirrors [MASK] developments in avant @-@ garde art , [MASK] <unk> . Although <unk> <unk> [MASK] through the use of what Ezra Pound called " [MASK] details " , Pound 's <unk> Method of [MASK] concrete instances to express an <unk> is similar to <unk> 's manner of <unk> multiple [MASK] into a [MASK] image . = = Pre @-@ <unk> = = Well @-@ [MASK] poets of the <unk> era of the 1890s , such as Alfred Austin , Stephen [MASK] , and [MASK] Watson , had been working very much in the shadow of Tennyson , producing weak [MASK] of the poetry of the [MASK] era . They continued to work in this vein into the [MASK] years of the 20th [MASK] . As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British Poet [MASK] , a post which he held up to 1913 . In the [MASK] 's first decade , poetry still had a large [MASK] ; volumes of verse [MASK] in that time included Thomas Hardy 's The <unk> , Christina <unk> 's [MASK] <unk> Works , Ernest <unk> 's Poems , George [MASK] 's Last Poems , Robert [MASK] 's <unk> of a <unk> and John <unk> 's <unk> and Poems . [MASK] Nobel Prize winner [MASK] Butler Yeats was <unk> much of his energy to the Abbey [MASK] and writing for the stage , producing [MASK] little lyric poetry during this period . In 1907 , the Nobel Prize for [MASK] was awarded to <unk> [MASK] . The origins of <unk> are to be found in two poems , [MASK] and A City Sunset by T. E. <unk> . These were [MASK] in January 1909 by the Poets ' Club in [MASK] in a booklet called For [MASK] <unk> . <unk> was a student of [MASK] and philosophy ; he had been involved in the [MASK] up of the club in 1908 and was its first [MASK] . Around the end of 1908 , he [MASK] his paper A <unk> on Modern Poetry at one of the club 's [MASK] . Writing in A. R. <unk> 's [MASK] The New Age , the poet and critic F. S. Flint ( a [MASK] of free verse and modern French poetry ) was highly [MASK] of the club and its [MASK] . From the ensuing debate , <unk> and Flint became close [MASK] . In 1909 , <unk> left the Poets ' Club and [MASK] meeting with [MASK] and other poets in a new group which <unk> [MASK] to as the " <unk> Club " ; they met at the <unk> Tower [MASK] in London 's <unk> to discuss plans to reform [MASK] poetry through free verse and the <unk> and <unk> and the [MASK] of all [MASK] <unk> from poems . The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a [MASK] of the late [MASK] and <unk> revival of interest in <unk> and <unk> as [MASK] in the 1890s vogue for William Anderson 's Japanese prints donated to the British Museum , [MASK] of <unk> plays in London , and the [MASK] of Gilbert and [MASK] 's <unk> The <unk> ( 1885 ) . Direct literary models were [MASK] from a number of sources , [MASK] F.

The American poet Ezra Pound was [MASK] to the group in April 1909 and [MASK] that their ideas were close to his own . In [MASK] , Pound 's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an [MASK] of the <unk> , direct [MASK] that he detected in the writings of <unk> Daniel , Dante , and <unk> <unk> , [MASK] others . For [MASK] , in his 1911 – 12 series of [MASK] I gather the limbs of Osiris , Pound [MASK] of Daniel 's line " <unk> de <unk> m [MASK] <unk> " ( " it rests me to think of her " ) ( from the [MASK] <unk> <unk> <unk> 'l <unk> <unk> ) : " You [MASK] get [MASK] simpler than that , or clearer , or less <unk> " . These [MASK] of <unk> , clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining [MASK] of <unk> poetry . Through his [MASK] with Laurence <unk> , Pound had already [MASK] an interest in Japanese art by [MASK] <unk> @-@ e prints at the British Museum , and he quickly became [MASK] in the study of related [MASK] verse forms . In an article in La [MASK] , 1915 , the French critic , <unk> de <unk> described the <unk> as [MASK] of the French <unk> and in a 1928 [MASK] to the French critic and [MASK] René <unk> , Pound was keen to emphasise another [MASK] for <unk> , pointing out that <unk> was indebted to a <unk> [MASK] , linking back via William Butler Yeats , Arthur Symons and the <unk> ' Club [MASK] of [MASK] poets to <unk> and the <unk> source was [MASK] further in <unk> 's study published in 1929 , in which he concluded however great the [MASK] of technique and [MASK] ' between the image of the <unk> and the ' [MASK] ' of the <unk> there is a [MASK] only of precision ' . In 1915 , Pound edited the poetry of [MASK] 1890s poet , Lionel Johnson for the publisher <unk> Mathews . In his [MASK] , he wrote = = Early [MASK] and statements of intent = = In 1911 , Pound [MASK] two other poets to the <unk> Tower group : his former [MASK] Hilda <unk> ( who had [MASK] signing her work <unk> ) and her future [MASK] Richard <unk> . These two were [MASK] in exploring Greek poetic models , especially <unk> , an interest that Pound shared . The [MASK] of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example [MASK] the proto @-@ <unk> [MASK] in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a [MASK] with them in the [MASK] Museum tea room , Pound told <unk> and <unk> that they were <unk> and even <unk> the [MASK] <unk> <unk> to some poems they were [MASK] . When Harriet Monroe started her Poetry [MASK] in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as [MASK] editor . In October 1912 , he [MASK] <unk> three poems each by <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> <unk> , ( [MASK] in the [MASK] 1912 second issue <unk> ) with a note which [MASK] <unk> as ' one of the ' <unk> ' . This note , [MASK] with the <unk> note ( ' The [MASK] Works of T. S. <unk> ' ) in Pound 's book ( also [MASK] in Autumn 1912 ) entitled <unk> are considered to be first [MASK] of the word [MASK] ( later <unk> to ' <unk> ' ) in [MASK] . <unk> 's poems , <unk> , To a [MASK] <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , were in the [MASK] issue of Poetry , and <unk> ' s , [MASK] of the Ways , <unk> , and <unk> , [MASK] in the January 1913 issue ; <unk> as a [MASK] was launched . Poetry 's April issue [MASK] what came to be seen as " <unk> 's [MASK] text " , the <unk> @-@ like poem of Ezra Pound [MASK] " In a Station of the [MASK] " : The <unk> of these faces in the [MASK] ; <unk> on a wet , black <unk> . The March 1913 issue of Poetry [MASK] A Few Don <unk> by an <unk> and the essay [MASK] <unk> both written by Pound , with the latter being [MASK] to Flint . The latter [MASK] this <unk> statement of the group 's position : Direct [MASK] of the " thing " , whether <unk> or [MASK] . To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the [MASK] . As [MASK] rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in [MASK] of the <unk> . Pound 's note opened with a [MASK] of an image as " that which presents an [MASK] and emotional [MASK] in an instant of time " . Pound goes on to state , " It is better to [MASK] one Image in a [MASK] than to produce <unk> works " . His list of " don <unk> " [MASK] his three [MASK] in " <unk> " , while warning that they should not be [MASK] as <unk> but as the " result of long [MASK] " . Taken together , these two texts [MASK] the <unk> programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic [MASK] of the past . <unk> Flint [MASK] " we have never claimed to have [MASK] the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are [MASK] . " The 1916 preface to Some <unk> Poets [MASK] " <unk> does not merely mean the [MASK] of pictures . <unk> refers to the manner of [MASK] , not to the subject . " = = Des [MASK] = = <unk> to promote the work of the <unk> , and [MASK] of <unk> and <unk> , Pound decided to publish an [MASK] under the title Des <unk> . It was first [MASK] in Alfred <unk> 's little [MASK] The <unk> and was later [MASK] in 1914 by Alfred and Charles <unk> in New York and by [MASK] <unk> at the Poetry <unk> in London . It became one of the most [MASK] and [MASK] English @-@ language collections of modernist verse . [MASK] in the thirty @-@ seven poems were ten poems by [MASK] , seven by <unk> , and six by Pound . The book also [MASK] work by <unk> Flint , <unk> <unk> , Amy Lowell , William Carlos [MASK] , [MASK] Joyce , Ford <unk> Ford , Allen <unk> and John <unk> <unk> was also another [MASK] in the [MASK] 1963 anthology by William Pratt The <unk> Poem Modern Poetry in [MASK] . Pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of [MASK] that these writers [MASK] with <unk> precepts , rather than active [MASK] in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not [MASK] in any of the [MASK] of the <unk> Tower group . However , he and Pound had long been [MASK] on the [MASK] of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford was [MASK] at least partly because of his strong [MASK] on Pound , as the younger poet made the [MASK] from his earlier , Pre @-@ <unk> @-@ [MASK] style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The [MASK] of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , [MASK] was sent to Pound by <unk> Yeats , took on a wider [MASK] in the history of literary <unk> , as the [MASK] [MASK] between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound 's behest , of A [MASK] of the [MASK] as a Young Man in The <unk> . Joyce 's poem is not [MASK] in free verse , but in rhyming <unk> . However , it [MASK] reflects Pound 's [MASK] in poems written to be sung to music , such as [MASK] by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> . The book met with little popular or [MASK] success , at least partly because it had no [MASK] or [MASK] to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were [MASK] to the [MASK] . = = Some <unk> Poets = = The [MASK] year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different [MASK] of the history and goals of the group [MASK] from an article on the history of <unk> written by Flint and [MASK] in The <unk> in May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the [MASK] of the <unk> Tower poets , [MASK] Edward <unk> . Pound , who [MASK] that the " Hellenic hardness " that he saw as the [MASK] quality of the poems of <unk> and <unk> was likely to be [MASK] by the " [MASK] " of <unk> , was to play no [MASK] direct role in the history of the <unk> . He went on to co @-@ [MASK] the <unk> with his friend , the [MASK] and writer <unk> Lewis . Around this time , the [MASK] <unk> Amy Lowell moved to London , [MASK] to promote her own work and that of the other <unk> poets . [MASK] was a wealthy <unk> from Boston whose brother Abbott [MASK] Lowell was President of Harvard [MASK] from 1909 @-@ 1933 . She loved Keats and cigars . She was also an [MASK] champion of literary [MASK] who was willing to use her money to publish the group . Lowell was [MASK] to change the method of [MASK] from Pound 's <unk> editorial attitude to a more [MASK] manner . This new editorial policy was stated in the <unk> to the first [MASK] to appear under her [MASK] : " In this new book we have followed a slightly different [MASK] to that of our former [MASK] . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been [MASK] to [MASK] himself by the work he considers his best , the only <unk> being that it [MASK] not yet have [MASK] in book form . " The outcome was a series of <unk> [MASK] under the title Some <unk> Poets . The first of these [MASK] in 1915 , planned and [MASK] mainly by <unk> and <unk> . Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were [MASK] in 1916 and 1917 . These three volumes [MASK] most of the original poets , ( also [MASK] <unk> poetry by the [MASK] poet John Gould Fletcher ) , with the [MASK] of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the <unk> name from her [MASK] and who <unk> [MASK] this phase of <unk> " Amy @-@ <unk> . " Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to [MASK] poems to the 1915 and 1916 [MASK] , making him the only writer to publish as both a [MASK] poet and an <unk> . <unk> Moore also became [MASK] with the group during this period . [MASK] , with World War I as a [MASK] , the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary [MASK] ( <unk> , for [MASK] , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology [MASK] marked the end of the <unk> as a [MASK] . = = <unk> after <unk> = = In 1929 , [MASK] <unk> <unk> [MASK] that <unk> should produce a new <unk> anthology . <unk> , by now a [MASK] novelist , took up the [MASK] and enlisted the help of Ford and <unk> The result was the <unk> [MASK] 1930 , edited by <unk> and including all the [MASK] to the four earlier [MASK] with the exception of Lowell , who had died , <unk> , who had [MASK] , and Pound , who declined . The [MASK] of this anthology initiated a critical [MASK] of the place of the <unk> in the [MASK] of 20th @-@ century poetry . Of the poets who were published in the various <unk> [MASK] , Joyce , Lawrence and <unk> are now primarily [MASK] and read as [MASK] . <unk> Moore , who was at most a [MASK] member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that [MASK] an <unk> concern with [MASK] of language . William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along [MASK] American lines with his variable foot and a [MASK] he claimed was taken " from the mouths of Polish [MASK] " . Both Pound and <unk> turned to writing long poems , but [MASK] much of the hard edge to their [MASK] as an <unk> legacy . Most of the other [MASK] of the group are largely [MASK] outside the context of the history of <unk> . = = Legacy = = Despite the [MASK] 's short life , <unk> would deeply [MASK] the course of [MASK] poetry in English . Richard <unk> , in his 1941 [MASK] , writes : " I think the poems of Ezra Pound , <unk> , [MASK] , and Ford <unk> Ford will [MASK] to be read . And to a [MASK] extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their [MASK] from positions won by the <unk> . " On the other hand , [MASK] Stevens found [MASK] in the <unk> approach : " Not all objects are [MASK] . The vice of <unk> was that it did not [MASK] this . " With its demand for hardness , clarity and precision and its [MASK] on fidelity to [MASK] coupled with its rejection of irrelevant <unk> emotions <unk> had later [MASK] that are <unk> in T. S. Eliot 's ' <unk> ' and ' [MASK] at the Window ' and in D. H. [MASK] 's animal and flower pieces . The rejection of [MASK] verse forms in the [MASK] @-@ twenties owed much to the <unk> <unk> of the Georgian Poetry style . The [MASK] of <unk> can be seen [MASK] in the work of the <unk> poets , who came to [MASK] in the 1930s under the [MASK] of Pound and Williams . The <unk> worked mainly in free verse . <unk> linking <unk> 's [MASK] with <unk> 's , Louis <unk> [MASK] , in his [MASK] to the 1931 <unk> issue of Poetry , on [MASK] " which is the detail , not <unk> , of seeing , of [MASK] with the things as they exist , and of [MASK] them along a line of melody . " <unk> was a major [MASK] on the [MASK] poets , who carried the <unk> focus on formal concerns to a high level of [MASK] . Basil <unk> , [MASK] <unk> poet , was a key figure in the early [MASK] of the British Poetry Revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the [MASK] of the San Francisco [MASK] poets . <unk> influenced a number of poetry circles and <unk> the <unk> Free verse became a [MASK] and acquired status as a [MASK] poetic form . In the 1950s , [MASK] , with the Beat generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others [MASK] with the San Francisco [MASK] . In his seminal 1950 essay <unk> Verse , Charles <unk> , the [MASK] of the Black [MASK] group , wrote " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> A <unk> <unk> " ; his <unk> derived from and [MASK] the <unk> . Among the Beats , Gary <unk> and Allen Ginsberg in [MASK] were influenced by the <unk> [MASK] on Chinese and Japanese poetry . William Carlos [MASK] was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , [MASK] poets like Lew Welch and writing an [MASK] for the book publication of Ginsberg 's <unk> ( 1955 ) . = [MASK] Eastern Exit = [MASK] Eastern Exit was the <unk> given to the military [MASK] of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , the [MASK] of Somalia , in January 1991 .

Over next two months , however , [MASK] in sea surface [MASK] , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their [MASK] downward and indicated the [MASK] for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June [MASK] . A rise in sea surface [MASK] in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their <unk> to [MASK] a near @-@ average season in their final August [MASK] update , which [MASK] 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their <unk> , with their April and [MASK] <unk> being the most accurate . [MASK] , <unk> working with the City [MASK] of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , [MASK] the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total [MASK] [MASK] , 26 tropical storms , and 16 <unk> .

The group was also [MASK] in their <unk> for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their [MASK] <unk> for the South China Sea were [MASK] off . During the year , the Japan [MASK] Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the [MASK] Date Line to the Malay [MASK] , and north of the [MASK] ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official Regional <unk> [MASK] Center , as designated by the World [MASK] Organization in 1989 .

In 2003 , the JMA [MASK] 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm [MASK] ; of those , 14 reached typhoon [MASK] . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between [MASK] storms and <unk> was 66 % greater than normal . The [MASK] <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services [MASK] ( PAGASA ) monitored three [MASK] cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not [MASK] by the JMA .

At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC [MASK] the system to tropical storm [MASK] , though the storm remained <unk> as the JMA [MASK] to classify it as a tropical [MASK] . Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again <unk> in strength , [MASK] in a brief <unk> by the JTWC to tropical [MASK] intensity . However , an increase in deep [MASK] resulted in its <unk> as a [MASK] storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA [MASK] the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on [MASK] 18 .

However , on April 24 , <unk> would resume a [MASK] track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was [MASK] to tropical [MASK] strength as it made landfall on <unk> . Following landfall , <unk> transitioned into an [MASK] cyclone on April 25 , which persisted until crossing the [MASK] Dateline towards the end of April 2003 . Shortly after [MASK] , <unk> caused two [MASK] in <unk> in addition to minor agricultural and [MASK] damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam .

[MASK] to the plan , in late morning <unk> 's column would emerge from the [MASK] first and launch a [MASK] assault on the French right . This [MASK] attack , combined with <unk> 's frontal assault from Stein , would force the [MASK] into a <unk> ; <unk> , they would have no [MASK] but to <unk> die . To ensure the [MASK] of the plan , the second and third [MASK] , under <unk> and <unk> , would arrive in early and mid @-@ [MASK] and support the earlier [MASK] . In this way , even if the French tried to [MASK] west to <unk> , they would not [MASK] the <unk> @-@ like grip of the [MASK] army . <unk> accepted the bait of a <unk> [MASK] retreat . In the early morning of 11 [MASK] he and <unk> departed from <unk> to seize Stein and <unk> , <unk> the Russians had either [MASK] the [MASK] or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind . As they [MASK] Stein , a column of <unk> 's troops attacked the French forward [MASK] . <unk> this force was the <unk> [MASK] rear guard , <unk> ordered Gen. <unk> to [MASK] and push east towards the town of Stein .

Initially <unk> made rapid progress , but he quickly [MASK] that the [MASK] force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a [MASK] army . Realizing he had been <unk> and that <unk> 's troops were tiring [MASK] , <unk> sent orders to <unk> 's [MASK] to <unk> forward . By mid @-@ morning the French [MASK] had stalled ; <unk> [MASK] most of his remaining forces to [MASK] <unk> back , leaving a single <unk> 300 <unk> cover his [MASK] flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minutes he [MASK] the [MASK] of numbers he sought .

At this stage of the battle [MASK] paused . <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's [MASK] while <unk> and <unk> [MASK] for <unk> 's and <unk> 's . <unk> 's column was [MASK] to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the [MASK] distance . The timing of the respite varies , [MASK] on whose reports are [MASK] : fighting paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . <unk> [MASK] first and [MASK] assaulted <unk> 's line with three battalions , [MASK] the French out of <unk> .

Despite <unk> 's [MASK] assault in the next two to [MASK] hours , <unk> and <unk> pushed the [MASK] back up the narrow <unk> in the [MASK] . At this point , <unk> 's column [MASK] behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were [MASK] more than three to one , [MASK] in the front by <unk> 's column , in the [MASK] by <unk> 's and in the rear by <unk> . Earlier in the morning <unk> had [MASK] with his [MASK] south and east along the river , from <unk> , according to [MASK] . Even before the arrival of [MASK] 's <unk> , he heard the sound of [MASK] in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to [MASK] that a Russian column ( <unk> 's ) was [MASK] from the [MASK] to take the road to <unk> . Realizing this would [MASK] him from the forward division , <unk> <unk> his troops toward the sound of battle and [MASK] them to take the [MASK] in the flank . The French assault , [MASK] by cannon fire , caused <unk> 's troops to turn their [MASK] from <unk> 's <unk> force to face these new <unk> . [MASK] superior in numbers , <unk> 's column had no [MASK] artillery , and the narrow space [MASK] them from taking advantage of their size . It was <unk> 's turn to face [MASK] at his front and rear , until the [MASK] of <unk> 's column , which had <unk> its way [MASK] the [MASK] in the west . <unk> arrived at dusk , and the action [MASK] well after dark ; in mid @-@ [MASK] night falls at close to 17 : 00 in the upper <unk> <unk> . Despite the [MASK] , <unk> [MASK] out of the <unk> and deployed his troops to <unk> <unk> 's flank . As his [MASK] entered the <unk> , they came between a [MASK] of French and another of Russians . With the [MASK] force , the French were [MASK] , but most of the shooting subsided when the [MASK] could not tell apart friend from [MASK] in the dark . Under the cover of [MASK] , <unk> used the French flotilla to evacuate his [MASK] troops to the south bank . The French and Russians [MASK] to <unk> <unk> into the night as <unk> [MASK] one another in the dark . <unk> of <unk> 's force provided any [MASK] rear guard action , and the [MASK] morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the <unk> , while they [MASK] possession of only [MASK] and <unk> on the north bank . = = = [MASK] = = = The losses were <unk> : <unk> lost close to 40 [MASK] of his [MASK] to death and wounds .

[MASK] , <unk> 's division was nearly [MASK] ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell [MASK] on his division . <unk> for both sides , the [MASK] was hard . The [MASK] had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the [MASK] , and <unk> " like [MASK] " hung from the trees . For the [MASK] , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the <unk> , awaiting [MASK] from <unk> ; the bridges between <unk> and Vienna had been [MASK] , making French access to the Austrian capital more [MASK] , but not [MASK] . After six months of fighting in which the [MASK] had enjoyed little good news , the [MASK] could claim a difficult and timely victory . The French had [MASK] from the field with a badly <unk> [MASK] and <unk> had secured the right flank . Indeed , [MASK] was so pleased with the outcome at <unk> that he awarded <unk> the [MASK] Order of Maria <unk> . For the French , the [MASK] of the Corps <unk> seemed [MASK] short of a miracle . The [MASK] of <unk> 's division crossed the river the next morning and [MASK] <unk> in Vienna , which the French acquired by deception later in the month . More [MASK] for them , the French force had [MASK] well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat [MASK] .

Despite this initial panic , <unk> 's column [MASK] its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands . <unk> had [MASK] his [MASK] <unk> : when he heard cannon fire , he [MASK] his troops toward it to support the French [MASK] . In terms of French staffing , <unk> 's failure to guard his flank , [MASK] in the face of Napoleon 's direct advice , adversely influenced his [MASK] with his [MASK] . However , in the immediate weeks ahead , the [MASK] <unk> did more to annoy Napoleon than <unk> had . In [MASK] the battle and its aftermath , [MASK] have laid the blame and credit for its [MASK] not only on <unk> and <unk> : " [MASK] , aware of <unk> 's danger and his own <unk> for it , vented his [MASK] on <unk> , whom he unjustly accused of [MASK] <unk> for the empty glory of riding [MASK] Vienna . " After the victory at <unk> , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and [MASK] <unk> . However [MASK] he may have been with <unk> , Napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's [MASK] . As [MASK] of his conduct in what the French called " the [MASK] Battle of <unk> " , <unk> received the [MASK] 's Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor . The loss of <unk> was a [MASK] blow to the Austrian military [MASK] .

In <unk> 's [MASK] <unk> , the architect of the Austrian [MASK] at <unk> in 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle plan of [MASK] action at <unk> . <unk> , [MASK] a far better <unk> than <unk> , and [MASK] of superior training and mapping skills , would have [MASK] a more realistic Coalition plan for <unk> . <unk> 's [MASK] would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a [MASK] , but it would have <unk> the [MASK] of the Coalition 's losses ; <unk> was [MASK] one of Napoleon 's finest <unk> . In the [MASK] picture , despite the important major naval [MASK] , the outcome of the War of the Third Coalition was [MASK] on the Continent , [MASK] in the two major land operations . In the Ulm campaign , the [MASK] achieved some minor victories , such as [MASK] 's at <unk> @-@ <unk> , but [MASK] lost an entire army and an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms [MASK] France until formally exchanged . This condition crippled the Austrian military [MASK] and forced the recall of such [MASK] as <unk> out of retirement . After the [MASK] at Ulm , isolated [MASK] of the Austrian military <unk> capture and joined with their [MASK] allies ; Michael von <unk> 's corps slipped out of the <unk> and [MASK] <unk> 's force .

His next two <unk> were as simply WWE [MASK] , while his final one was as WWE World [MASK] Champion . = [MASK] k filter = Constant k <unk> , also k @-@ type [MASK] , are a type of [MASK] filter designed using the image method . They are the original and simplest <unk> produced by this [MASK] and consist of a ladder network of [MASK] sections of passive components . [MASK] , they are the first <unk> that could approach the ideal filter [MASK] response to within any [MASK] limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections . However , they are rarely [MASK] for a modern design , the [MASK] behind them having been superseded by other [MASK] which are more accurate in their prediction of filter [MASK] . = = History = = Constant k <unk> were invented by George Campbell . He [MASK] his work in 1922 , but had clearly [MASK] the <unk> some time before , as his [MASK] at AT & T Co , Otto <unk> , was [MASK] making [MASK] to the design at this time . Campbell 's <unk> were far [MASK] to the simpler single element circuits that had been used [MASK] . Campbell called his <unk> [MASK] wave <unk> , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some [MASK] but not [MASK] . Many new forms of wave filter were [MASK] invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @-@ [MASK] filter by <unk> who coined the term [MASK] k for the Campbell filter in order to [MASK] them . The great advantage Campbell 's <unk> had over the <unk> [MASK] and other simple <unk> of the time was that they could be [MASK] for any desired degree of stop band rejection or <unk> of [MASK] [MASK] pass band and stop band . It was only [MASK] to add more filter sections until the desired response was [MASK] . The <unk> were designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating <unk> telephone channels on [MASK] lines , but their [MASK] use has been much more widespread than that . The design [MASK] used by Campbell have largely been [MASK] . However , the ladder <unk> used by [MASK] with the constant k is still in use today with <unk> of modern filter [MASK] such as the <unk> filter . [MASK] gave constant k designs for low @-@ [MASK] , high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass <unk> . Band @-@ stop and [MASK] band <unk> are also [MASK] . = = <unk> = = Some of the <unk> terms and [MASK] terms used in this article are [MASK] in the diagram below . Image theory defines [MASK] in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port [MASK] , and in the case of the <unk> being [MASK] , an infinite ladder network of L @-@ [MASK] . Here " L " should not be confused with the <unk> L – in [MASK] filter <unk> , " L " refers to the [MASK] filter shape which [MASK] inverted letter " L " . The sections of the [MASK] infinite filter are made of series elements having <unk> <unk> and <unk> [MASK] with <unk> <unk> . The factor of two is introduced for [MASK] convenience , since it is [MASK] to work in terms of half @-@ sections where it [MASK] . The image <unk> of the input and output port of a section will [MASK] not be the same . [MASK] , for a mid @-@ series [MASK] ( that is , a section from halfway [MASK] a series element to halfway through the next series [MASK] ) will have the same image <unk> on both ports due to symmetry . This image <unk> is [MASK] [MASK] due to the " T " <unk> of a mid @-@ series section . [MASK] , the image <unk> of a mid @-@ <unk> section is [MASK] <unk> due to the " [MASK] " <unk> . Half of such a " T " or " <unk> " [MASK] is called a half @-@ [MASK] , which is also an L @-@ [MASK] but with half the element values of the full L @-@ [MASK] . The image <unk> of the half @-@ [MASK] is <unk> on the input and output ports : on the side [MASK] the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ [MASK] <unk> , but on the side [MASK] the <unk> element it is [MASK] to the mid @-@ <unk> <unk> . There are thus two [MASK] ways of using a half @-@ section . Parts of this [MASK] or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex <unk> [MASK] of <unk> and <unk> and on knowledge of the frequency domain [MASK] of signals . = = <unk> = = The [MASK] block of [MASK] k <unk> is the half @-@ section " L " network , [MASK] of a series <unk> Z , and a [MASK] <unk> <unk> The " k " in " [MASK] k " is the value given by , [MASK] Thus , k will have units of <unk> , that is , <unk> . It is [MASK] [MASK] that in order for k to be constant , Y must be the dual <unk> of Z. A [MASK] [MASK] of k can be given by observing that k is the [MASK] value of <unk> as the size of the section ( in terms of values of its [MASK] , such as [MASK] , <unk> , etc . ) [MASK] zero , while keeping k at its initial value . Thus , k is the [MASK] <unk> , <unk> , of the [MASK] line that would be formed by these <unk> small [MASK] . It is also the image <unk> of the section at [MASK] , in the case of band @-@ pass [MASK] , or at <unk> = 0 in the case of low @-@ pass [MASK] . For example , the [MASK] low @-@ pass half @-@ section has [MASK] . Elements L and C can be made <unk> small while [MASK] the same value of k . Z and Y however , are both [MASK] zero , and from the [MASK] ( below ) for image <unk> , [MASK] . = = = Image <unk> = = = See also [MASK] <unk> # <unk> The image <unk> of the section are given by [MASK] and <formula> Given that the filter does not contain any <unk> [MASK] , the [MASK] <unk> in the pass band of the [MASK] is purely real and in the stop band it is purely [MASK] . For example , for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section , <formula> The [MASK] occurs at a cut @-@ off [MASK] given by <formula> Below this [MASK] , the image <unk> is real , [MASK] Above the cut @-@ off frequency the image <unk> is imaginary , <formula> = = = <unk> [MASK] = = = The [MASK] parameters for a general constant k half @-@ section are given by [MASK] and for a chain of n half @-@ sections [MASK] For the low @-@ pass L @-@ shape [MASK] , below the cut @-@ off frequency , the [MASK] parameters are given by <formula> That is , the [MASK] is <unk> in the pass @-@ band with only the phase of the [MASK] changing . Above the cut @-@ off [MASK] , the [MASK] parameters are : <formula> = = = <unk> <unk> = = = The [MASK] plots of image <unk> , <unk> and phase change [MASK] to a low @-@ pass [MASK] filter section . The prototype has a cut @-@ off [MASK] of <unk> = 1 <unk> / s and a [MASK] <unk> k = 1 <unk> . This is [MASK] by a filter half @-@ section with <unk> L = 1 [MASK] and <unk> C = 1 <unk> . This [MASK] can be <unk> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The low @-@ pass [MASK] can also be [MASK] into high @-@ pass , band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by [MASK] of suitable [MASK] <unk> . = = <unk> sections = = Several L @-@ shape half @-@ [MASK] may be <unk> to form a [MASK] filter . Like <unk> must always face like in these [MASK] . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two [MASK] L @-@ shaped half @-@ [MASK] . Where a port of image <unk> <unk> faces [MASK] <unk> , the section is called a <unk> [MASK] . Where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a T section . Further [MASK] of half @-@ [MASK] to either of these section forms a ladder [MASK] which may start and end with series or <unk> [MASK] . It should be borne in mind that the [MASK] of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is [MASK] with its image <unk> . This is usually not true of the [MASK] at either end , which are usually [MASK] with a fixed [MASK] . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the [MASK] will become , since the effects of the [MASK] <unk> are masked by the [MASK] sections . = The <unk> = " The <unk> " is an [MASK] of the British science fiction [MASK] series Doctor Who , first broadcast on [MASK] Day 2012 on BBC One .

He <unk> [MASK] that a person dying twice is an [MASK] and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the <unk> to [MASK] and find <unk> .

The events of The Web of Fear are [MASK] to by the Doctor in " The <unk> " when he [MASK] the London Underground <unk> tin to the Great [MASK] in Dr <unk> 's laboratory ; the [MASK] states , " I do not [MASK] these markings " , in reference to the 1967 London [MASK] map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the [MASK] is a " key strategic weakness in [MASK] living " , referring to ( and [MASK] setting in motion ) the future <unk> attack on London via the [MASK] . Coleman previously played <unk> Oswald in " [MASK] of the <unk> " , though the [MASK] between the two characters is not clarified until <unk> reveals she has an [MASK] in <unk> , a trait that <unk> 's [MASK] also had . The Doctor , after [MASK] <unk> , <unk> replies " those were the days " when she asks why he isn 't [MASK] to get [MASK] with her , which are the same [MASK] he tells Craig <unk> ( " <unk> Time " ) when Craig [MASK] that the Doctor always wins .

" Moffat compared the [MASK] Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first [MASK] of the First Doctor ( [MASK] <unk> ) in 1963 and the <unk> Doctor ( [MASK] Eccleston ) in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot [MASK] by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but [MASK] by the [MASK] team at the time . Continuing the theme [MASK] with the series ' first five episodes , " The <unk> " was [MASK] like a movie . A movie poster was [MASK] in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor and <unk> [MASK] the ladder to the <unk> . The [MASK] saw several major design changes for the [MASK] . " The <unk> " is the debut of a [MASK] <unk> interior , as well as a new title sequence and [MASK] of the theme tune . The new title [MASK] features a brief glimpse of the Doctor 's face , the first time since [MASK] , the final serial of the [MASK] series in 1989 , that the [MASK] 's face has been seen in the title [MASK] . Moffat had noticed that the <unk> ' design was getting " [MASK] whimsical " and resembled more of a " [MASK] place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series [MASK] designer Michael <unk> , who stated that the new [MASK] was also supposed to be " darker and <unk> " and [MASK] an easier access to the " [MASK] " of the ship when [MASK] . The Doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume , [MASK] @-@ themed , which Smith described as " a bit <unk> <unk> meets the [MASK] " . Moffat described the new outfit as a " [MASK] " as the Doctor was in " a [MASK] phase of his life now " and felt more " [MASK] @-@ up " and <unk> . The costume was [MASK] by Howard <unk> for this [MASK] . " The <unk> " also contains several [MASK] to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor [MASK] up as him . Moffat is co @-@ creator of the BBC series [MASK] , for which Smith [MASK] for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor . In addition , the [MASK] music during the scene bears a [MASK] to the Sherlock theme . = = = [MASK] = = = This episode marks the return of Jenna @-@ Louise [MASK] , who [MASK] appeared in the series opener , " Asylum of the <unk> " .

The [MASK] team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced [MASK] keep Coleman 's appearance a secret until " Asylum " was [MASK] ; the effort was ultimately successful . Moffat stated that the [MASK] of a new [MASK] made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new [MASK] " with a [MASK] person meeting the Doctor . Smith said that <unk> was different from her [MASK] Amy Pond ( Karen <unk> ) , which allowed the [MASK] to see a [MASK] side of the Doctor . Coleman described her as [MASK] and not intimidated , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the [MASK] as pursuing answers . The <unk> who would become a [MASK] companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring [MASK] , " The [MASK] of Saint John " ; save for a brief [MASK] at the end of " The <unk> " . Coleman stated that she played each version as [MASK] with " trust that there would be a [MASK] " to her mystery . Also [MASK] to the series are Neve <unk> as [MASK] <unk> , Dan <unk> as <unk> and <unk> Stewart as Jenny . All three [MASK] appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " and [MASK] their roles both in this [MASK] and in the <unk> . They returned due to the [MASK] of <unk> and Jenny ; Moffat [MASK] a spin @-@ off featuring them , [MASK] he did not have the time to do it . [MASK] , he decided to bring them back in the main series . Richard E. Grant had [MASK] played the Doctor on two occasions , as an [MASK] Tenth Doctor in the spoof [MASK] special Doctor Who and the Curse of <unk> Death , which was [MASK] by Moffat and as an [MASK] <unk> Doctor in the animated story Scream of the <unk> which had been [MASK] to be a [MASK] of the series before it was revived in 2005 .

The <unk> was [MASK] designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the [MASK] for the British Army . It improved upon its [MASK] , the Mk <unk> Light Tank , by [MASK] the extra firepower of a 2 @-@ [MASK] gun . The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that [MASK] increased to 220 . [MASK] was delayed by several factors , and as a [MASK] , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were [MASK] . The tank 's design flaws , combined with the [MASK] by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured [MASK] , ruled out the use of <unk> in the North African [MASK] . As a result , the [MASK] of the tanks remained in Britain , [MASK] 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the <unk> @-@ <unk> [MASK] . In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three [MASK] for use in overseas [MASK] operations , one of which was [MASK] with <unk> . In May 1942 , a small number of <unk> formed part of the [MASK] force which [MASK] in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , <unk> were [MASK] to the 1st Airborne [MASK] after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ [MASK] light tank to support British airborne forces . The <unk> were [MASK] and landed in [MASK] designed General Aircraft <unk> gliders . A lack of gliders prevented their [MASK] in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instead they were [MASK] to the new 6th [MASK] Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured [MASK] Regiment . The division used approximately 20 <unk> during the British [MASK] landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were [MASK] landed by glider , but they did not [MASK] well . Several were lost in [MASK] , and those that did see action proved to be inferior in [MASK] and armour to the armoured [MASK] vehicles of the German forces . A few days after the [MASK] of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct [MASK] with German armour and used only to [MASK] fire support . By August 1944 , most of the <unk> in action were [MASK] with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the [MASK] were replaced by the <unk> <unk> in [MASK] 1944 . <unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed [MASK] by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 . There were several [MASK] on the <unk> design , [MASK] the <unk> self @-@ [MASK] gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active [MASK] with the British Army . = = [MASK] history = = = = = Initial [MASK] = = = The prototype of the [MASK] Tank Mk VII ( <unk> ) , [MASK] ' <unk> ' , was first developed in 1937 by [MASK] @-@ <unk> as a private venture , and was [MASK] to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign [MASK] . It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks [MASK] by the company . The tank was designed to overcome the [MASK] of [MASK] armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns . Vickers @-@ [MASK] installed on the Mk <unk> a 2 @-@ pounder 40 @-@ [MASK] ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) main gun [MASK] with a 7 @.@ 92 @-@ [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 312 in ) <unk> [MASK] gun , and mounted the two guns in a two @-@ man [MASK] . The tank possessed a maximum of 14 [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) of armour . The prototype weighed [MASK] 16 @,@ 800 [MASK] ( 7 @,@ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @-@ [MASK] ( 123 kW ) [MASK] engine . <unk> was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no [MASK] driver or <unk> wheels and it was [MASK] of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top [MASK] . The Mk VII design relied on an unusual [MASK] method and a mechanical system [MASK] into earlier Vickers models . The front wheels could be [MASK] to allow for gentle turns by <unk> the tracks . For [MASK] turns , the system returned to the [MASK] method of <unk> one track to turn the tank ; the dual [MASK] of turning was designed to lessen [MASK] strain on the <unk> and reduce its power <unk> . The [MASK] system was also a new [MASK] that relied on struts with [MASK] of air for <unk> and <unk> of oil for <unk> , and each of the wheels was [MASK] sprung . The War Office [MASK] the design and put the [MASK] through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was tested as a [MASK] " light [MASK] " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its [MASK] , the Mark VI . The War [MASK] then took the view that the tank was not [MASK] as a light cruiser because the <unk> <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing [MASK] . Despite this , it was decided that it was [MASK] for some <unk> to be produced , and it was [MASK] that they be [MASK] in at the end of the light tank program . [MASK] , the War Office gave the <unk> the official General Staff [MASK] number <unk> , and , in [MASK] 1938 , accepted it for limited [MASK] after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an [MASK] fuel tank to increase the tank 's range . = = = [MASK] = = = The number to be [MASK] was subject to <unk> as the War [MASK] <unk> in their demand ; in July 1938 , it [MASK] that 70 of the tanks be produced , then [MASK] the request to 120 after a three @-@ day [MASK] in November .

[MASK] of the tank was [MASK] by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ [MASK] of France decision to focus military [MASK] on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor [MASK] of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the [MASK] of more [MASK] tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were [MASK] deployed against them ; the resulting high [MASK] led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the [MASK] of the light tank [MASK] . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of [MASK] , meanwhile had been found to be [MASK] suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country [MASK] . [MASK] delays were caused by the bombing raids of the [MASK] during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled . The [MASK] effect of these delays resulted in the [MASK] of only a small number of Mk <unk> ; [MASK] place the final total produced to be [MASK] 100 and 177 . The name ' <unk> ' was given to the Mk VII , on 22 [MASK] 1941 , on the [MASK] of the War Office . The last of the [MASK] were built in the first quarter of 1942 and [MASK] at the end of the year . = = = [MASK] to airborne role = = = The War Office and the Army were [MASK] , at this [MASK] , that light tanks were a liability and too [MASK] for use in further combat , and the <unk> was [MASK] to be obsolete . This [MASK] may have marked the end for the <unk> in active service ; several of the tanks [MASK] to be [MASK] to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African [MASK] were left in Britain when their cooling systems were [MASK] to be unable to cope with the [MASK] North African heat . The demise of <unk> was [MASK] by a decision made by the War Office in mid @-@ 1941 , as it was [MASK] the [MASK] to be used by Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , [MASK] in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , Winston [MASK] . When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces , [MASK] at the War Office [MASK] that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would [MASK] troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include [MASK] and some form of tank . Plans to [MASK] a tank went through a number of [MASK] , but , by May 1941 , the [MASK] of a 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 4 long tons ) tank to be [MASK] for 350 miles ( 560 km ) in a [MASK] was [MASK] , although the aircraft would have to be [MASK] designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 [MASK] 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft <unk> , currently under [MASK] , would be used to [MASK] a single <unk> tank or two Universal <unk> . The <unk> was chosen [MASK] it was an obsolete design , and was [MASK] available to be used by the airborne forces . [MASK] in January 1944 , training [MASK] were conducted carrying the <unk> and their crews inside <unk> gliders . These exercises were [MASK] ; during the [MASK] by ' C ' Squadron of the <unk> Pilot Regiment , which [MASK] in flying the <unk> , over 2 @,@ 800 <unk> were made with an [MASK] of 50 <unk> per crew . Only three [MASK] resulted in [MASK] or injuries , with seven pilots killed during the training . When the <unk> was re @-@ [MASK] as an [MASK] tank , several changes were made to its [MASK] . A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76 @.@ 2 @-@ [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) [MASK] support howitzer ; these tanks were then [MASK] as <unk> 1 <unk> ( Close Support ) . [MASK] , <unk> <unk> were added to those <unk> which still [MASK] their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour [MASK] . The <unk> [MASK] several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and [MASK] forces . One of the major problems was the [MASK] number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 , which [MASK] affected the airborne forces . The [MASK] of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the <unk> @-@ <unk> Act [MASK] the number [MASK] for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during [MASK] <unk> , the invasion of [MASK] . A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that [MASK] 50 <unk> were available for use . In a [MASK] , dated January 1943 , by Major General George F. <unk> , [MASK] of the 1st Airborne Division , <unk> [MASK] that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were [MASK] , whereas only 50 [MASK] remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat . This lack of [MASK] [MASK] reserves , combined with a War Office report that some <unk> [MASK] tanks would be required for the 1st [MASK] Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India , led to the <unk> 's eventual [MASK] by the US <unk> <unk> . = = [MASK] = = A [MASK] of design faults of the <unk> were revealed through its [MASK] use . Its size limited the [MASK] crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and [MASK] in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the <unk> [MASK] . The gunner or [MASK] , in addition to his own [MASK] , had to act as <unk> for the 2 [MASK] , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank [MASK] in January 1941 stated that as the [MASK] had to both fight and control the tank , [MASK] a troop of <unk> during combat would be almost [MASK] . Problems were also found with the <unk> <unk> fitted to the 2 @-@ pounder to [MASK] its range and [MASK] power ; after they had been fitted the <unk> could not be [MASK] , and could only fire [MASK] designed armour @-@ piercing rounds , which took time to [MASK] . The War Office also considered the <unk> 's [MASK] system faulty , making the tank [MASK] for service in <unk> climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa . = = [MASK] history = = = = = [MASK] @-@ lease = = = The first <unk> were [MASK] to the Army in November 1940 , and were [MASK] deployed with the 1st [MASK] Division ( which was being refitted after losing the [MASK] of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th [MASK] Division . However , the faults [MASK] with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being [MASK] into units that were sent to the Middle East to [MASK] in the North African Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were [MASK] from the [MASK] of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service . The <unk> [MASK] in Britain , and would [MASK] have been used as training vehicles before being [MASK] from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation [MASK] began , and the USSR became an ally of [MASK] . The <unk> @-@ <unk> [MASK] , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply [MASK] materials to Britain and China , was [MASK] extended to the USSR . As part of the program , the British [MASK] began [MASK] war materials to the USSR , which in early 1942 , [MASK] a shipment of 20 <unk> , as well as a number of [MASK] and Matilda Mk I [MASK] tanks . The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the [MASK] , and so could use the <unk> . When the tanks [MASK] in the USSR , however , it was [MASK] that the design [MASK] with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; [MASK] , the cold weather had a <unk> effect on the tank 's [MASK] and tracks . [MASK] testing of the <unk> was conducted by the Soviet [MASK] and the design was admired for its <unk> , <unk> , and speed , as well its [MASK] to run on low @-@ quality fuel , unlike [MASK] Soviet [MASK] . The <unk> of the <unk> 's armour was found to be a [MASK] and one which could not be solved , as the weight of extra armour [MASK] caused an [MASK] reduction in the tank 's speed . Despite these [MASK] in the <unk> 's design , Soviet [MASK] believed it to be comparable to the T @-@ 70 [MASK] tank in use at the time , and decided that it was [MASK] to be used in combat . A number of <unk> were sent to Tank [MASK] Schools which were [MASK] sent into battle , and in [MASK] 1943 two were assigned to the <unk> <unk> Tank [MASK] , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were [MASK] in combat , one on 30 [MASK] and the other on 2 October , the latter a casualty of [MASK] fire . Several were also used for propaganda purposes , appearing in [MASK] of Soviet troops who were [MASK] in the <unk> region . = = = [MASK] <unk> = = = In mid @-@ 1941 , the Royal [MASK] Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas [MASK] , known as ' A ' , ' B ' [MASK] ' C ' Special Service [MASK] . Both ' A ' and ' B ' [MASK] were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark [MASK] light tanks , but ' C ' Squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> [MASK] from the 2nd [MASK] Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On 31 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was [MASK] activated and [MASK] received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an [MASK] tropical climate . All three squadrons were [MASK] to <unk> in Scotland for intensive training that focused on [MASK] and <unk> from ships and [MASK] craft to prepare them for action in potential [MASK] operations . In early September , elements of ' C ' Squadron , [MASK] six <unk> , formed part of a force which sailed for [MASK] in West [MASK] ; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish [MASK] might enter the [MASK] on the side of Germany , and the force was <unk> to [MASK] a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this [MASK] . These fears [MASK] <unk> , and in March 1942 , the unit [MASK] to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training . The next [MASK] , Operation <unk> , was the invasion of [MASK] , the third largest island in the world and then under <unk> French [MASK] . The Prime [MASK] and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that [MASK] should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of <unk> to [MASK] naval forces , which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean . [MASK] <unk> was under the [MASK] of Major General Robert G. <unk> and consisted of No. 5 Commando , 29th [MASK] [MASK] Group , and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th [MASK] Division . The 29th Brigade formed the core of the [MASK] force due to its training in [MASK] operations , and under its command was ' B ' Special Service [MASK] , created by <unk> six <unk> from ' B ' [MASK] and six <unk> from ' C ' [MASK] into a single unit . The squadron was formed into four troops , one [MASK] troop of [MASK] <unk> and one <unk> , one of four <unk> , and two formed from the [MASK] five <unk> . The invasion force [MASK] off the west coast of the northern tip of [MASK] on 4 May , near <unk> and the bay of Diego <unk> . The [MASK] plan called for an [MASK] assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip , [MASK] would allow the British forces to advance [MASK] 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach <unk> from the rear . [MASK] about the landing beaches , the defences [MASK] by the port , and the <unk> French [MASK] forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the [MASK] had no weapons capable of [MASK] the armour of a [MASK] tank . The landings began at 04 : 30 on 5 May , with 5 [MASK] landing at <unk> Bay and the three [MASK] brigades and ' B ' Squadron landing at <unk> Bay . The [MASK] of the [MASK] brigades and their armoured support was to take control of <unk> and a nearby town , but [MASK] the infantry landed [MASK] , ' B ' Squadron had more trouble ; the area of beach [MASK] for its landing craft was [MASK] for several hours after a <unk> came loose from a [MASK] craft and became stuck in the sand . The [MASK] brigades advanced toward <unk> without the squadron , but [MASK] two <unk> and a single <unk> were [MASK] in support , catching up with the lead [MASK] of the infantry near the town of <unk> . Here the invasion force [MASK] the first French defences , consisting of [MASK] trenches and <unk> dug in along a ridge . The tanks [MASK] to breach them , but the rocky ground made <unk> [MASK] and they could not close with the <unk> and [MASK] ; they engaged a number of [MASK] with 2 pounder and machine @-@ gun fire , but the line had to be [MASK] by an [MASK] assault later in the day . The tanks were ordered to [MASK] the defences and advance further into the [MASK] , and they were soon joined by two other <unk> [MASK] from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it [MASK] the <unk> French main line of [MASK] . This had been built prior to the First World War and included [MASK] <unk> , machine @-@ gun nests and dug @-@ in 75 mm [MASK] pieces ; the latter , although not [MASK] designed for an anti @-@ tank role , could [MASK] the armour of both the [MASK] and the <unk> . The two <unk> advanced first but were knocked out by [MASK] fire , and two <unk> that were moving behind them [MASK] the same fate ; the third <unk> [MASK] in order to report on the French [MASK] , machine <unk> a motorcycle [MASK] and a truck it encountered on the way back . The [MASK] of the <unk> made his report , and was then [MASK] to take command of four <unk> and two <unk> which had [MASK] arrived and once again attempt to breach the French [MASK] . The tanks followed the road leading to the [MASK] line and then [MASK] to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side , using [MASK] hills as cover ; the [MASK] pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one [MASK] and one <unk> were hit and [MASK] . The remaining tanks [MASK] several <unk> of fire with the artillery pieces before [MASK] back to their original positions . The French line was [MASK] broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an [MASK] assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' [MASK] , two <unk> and three <unk> , remained in [MASK] positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic [MASK] fire which disabled another [MASK] . The squadron played no further part in the battle , as the <unk> French [MASK] negotiated a formal [MASK] the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British [MASK] force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy [MASK] during the invasion ; only one [MASK] and three <unk> out of twelve tanks were [MASK] by 7 May , and the [MASK] had suffered seven killed and six wounded . It remained in [MASK] until early 1943 , when it was [MASK] to India and took part in the Burma [MASK] as part of 29th Brigade . = = = [MASK] Tonga = = = Because of a lack of equipment training [MASK] in mid @-@ 1940 , when the British airborne [MASK] was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 [MASK] for training as airborne troops . Progress in setting up proper training [MASK] and [MASK] suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne [MASK] , Operation <unk> , was conducted by a <unk> [MASK] unit . By 1942 , there existed [MASK] trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne [MASK] , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office [MASK] that a light tank unit would be one of the support units [MASK] to the division . This unit , [MASK] the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of [MASK] light tanks and would operate to the fore of the [MASK] , using their tanks ' speed to capture [MASK] and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for [MASK] was ' C ' Special [MASK] Squadron , as it was trained to act as an [MASK] tank unit and , more [MASK] , was the only unit that was still using <unk> ; it had been re @-@ [MASK] as an [MASK] tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially [MASK] to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , [MASK] with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles . The unit [MASK] began training , but was not [MASK] to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the [MASK] was [MASK] to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied [MASK] of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron [MASK] in Britain , as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to [MASK] its <unk> ; the squadron was [MASK] to the 6th [MASK] Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' [MASK] remained with it for the rest of the conflict . The squadron [MASK] to train as an air @-@ portable unit , and [MASK] in a number of [MASK] to prepare for its new duties , including [MASK] of enemy positions and counter @-@ [MASK] enemy infantry and armour . On 13 December 1943 , the War Office decided to expand the [MASK] into a regiment equipped with a [MASK] of light tanks and conventional [MASK] vehicles such as scout cars , and on 1 April 1944 , it was re @-@ [MASK] as the 6th Airborne Armoured [MASK] Regiment . The regiment consisted of a [MASK] Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a [MASK] Squadron ; two <unk> , the Mark 1 <unk> variation , were attached to the [MASK] Squadron , but the Light Tank [MASK] , also known as ' A ' [MASK] , received the majority of the <unk> . ' A ' Squadron had [MASK] nineteen <unk> split [MASK] six troops , two of which were of the <unk> [MASK] and the rest were armed with 2 pounders [MASK] with <unk> <unk> . On 24 May 1944 , after [MASK] in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres , ' A ' [MASK] moved from their training area to a transit camp at <unk> <unk> [MASK] , while the rest of the [MASK] moved to RAF <unk> Norton airfield the next day ; from these two [MASK] , the regiment would be [MASK] from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy . The [MASK] began on the night of 5 June , with the [MASK] of 6th [MASK] Division to eastern Normandy . It was tasked with [MASK] the eastern flank of the Allied <unk> landings , securing [MASK] important areas east of Caen , capturing several [MASK] bridges over the Caen Canal and River <unk> , and [MASK] a coastal artillery battery . <unk> transport aircraft were [MASK] to land all three of the division 's brigades [MASK] ; one would have to be landed in a [MASK] lift later in the day . Major General Richard Gale had [MASK] intended for the 6th <unk> Brigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured [MASK] Regiment was [MASK] , to be landed first ; however , aerial [MASK] revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone [MASK] for the brigade . [MASK] , Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th [MASK] Brigade ( which did not <unk> gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the [MASK] zones , [MASK] the 6th <unk> Brigade to land in the second lift . The <unk> and <unk> [MASK] of the [MASK] landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of [MASK] by the 5th [MASK] Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in [MASK] and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in [MASK] the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured [MASK] Squadron was to aid in the [MASK] task , acting as a [MASK] force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces [MASK] to counter @-@ attack . The <unk> of ' A ' [MASK] were to play an integral part in this [MASK] role due to their speed , but the [MASK] 's strength of twenty tanks was [MASK] depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the [MASK] landed when the <unk> broke loose of its <unk> and [MASK] through the nose of the glider that was [MASK] it , [MASK] both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The [MASK] 's strength was further weakened when two gliders [MASK] with each other in the landing zone , [MASK] themselves and the <unk> they carried ; a third <unk> hit [MASK] <unk> as it was being <unk> and flipped the tank upside down , [MASK] it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The [MASK] tanks were then rendered [MASK] immobile when parachute rigging lines became [MASK] in their <unk> , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding <unk> . The squadron [MASK] all of the [MASK] <unk> and advanced to the south of the [MASK] zone to link up with the rest of the [MASK] ; there , they received orders to support the 8th [MASK] Battalion in the <unk> de <unk> area and conduct [MASK] duties . After linking with the [MASK] , the squadron began <unk> , and engaged German infantry and armour they [MASK] . By the end of 7 June , two [MASK] had been lost to enemy action , one [MASK] by a German self @-@ propelled gun and the second by [MASK] a mine . The division was [MASK] by British troops who were advancing from the [MASK] beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its [MASK] duties . At this time , Gale decided to avoid , when [MASK] , [MASK] the <unk> with German armour , as they proved to be [MASK] <unk> by the German tanks and self @-@ [MASK] guns , such as the Panzer IV and the <unk> III . Instead , when the [MASK] [MASK] armoured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the [MASK] , and the <unk> were used to support [MASK] patrols and provide fire support . By August , in the division 's [MASK] for the planned breakout from the Normandy [MASK] , the majority of <unk> in ' A ' [MASK] were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three <unk> [MASK] , assigned to the [MASK] troop of ' A ' Squadron . = = = Post @-@ war = = = [MASK] Tonga was the last that <unk> saw of [MASK] combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th [MASK] Armoured [MASK] Regiment underwent an extensive <unk> , in which it was [MASK] <unk> , and all the remaining <unk> were retired . They were [MASK] with the <unk> <unk> , a purpose @-@ built [MASK] light tank of American design ; eight <unk> were used by the [MASK] in March 1945 during [MASK] <unk> , the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine . A [MASK] issued by the [MASK] ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the <unk> design was [MASK] obsolete , and any light tanks used in post @-@ war [MASK] [MASK] would be entirely new in design . A small number of <unk> [MASK] in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; a <unk> glider flight was [MASK] at RAF [MASK] , and a troop of <unk> was kept by the regiment for training [MASK] with the gliders . However , glider [MASK] by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the <unk> [MASK] from service . = = <unk> = = There were several [MASK] of the <unk> [MASK] . The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII , Vickers @-@ [MASK] 's proposed successor to the <unk> . The Mark VIII was also [MASK] as the Harry Hopkins , named after President Roosevelt 's chief [MASK] advisor , and was given the [MASK] Staff design number <unk> by the War Office . The Mark VIII was [MASK] to [MASK] upon the design of the <unk> in a number of areas . It had [MASK] armour than the <unk> , with the front hull and turret armour [MASK] to a thickness of 38 [MASK] ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) , and the [MASK] and hull given more sloped [MASK] to help <unk> shells fired at the tank . The [MASK] of the <unk> were also [MASK] ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) and [MASK] . The new tank was no longer air @-@ [MASK] , as it was too heavy to be carried by a <unk> . The 12 @-@ [MASK] engine of the <unk> was [MASK] to the Mark VIII , although the [MASK] weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 [MASK] per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its [MASK] also remained the same as that of the <unk> . The War Office authorised the [MASK] of three [MASK] models in April 1941 . The new design was [MASK] a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office [MASK] 1 @,@ 000 to be [MASK] in September . However , problems were encountered with further tests of the [MASK] , and a report issued in December 1942 stated that [MASK] of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to [MASK] problems . These problems [MASK] to persist into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service ; [MASK] 100 Mark <unk> were produced by 1945 , when [MASK] ended . A second [MASK] on the <unk> design was the [MASK] <unk> Drive ( " <unk> DD " ) . The <unk> Drive system was [MASK] by Nicholas <unk> , and was [MASK] to allow a tank to ' swim ' through water and [MASK] in amphibious operations . The system [MASK] by <unk> a large <unk> canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was [MASK] by [MASK] @-@ six <unk> tubes and steel struts ; this gave the tank [MASK] <unk> to float , and was then [MASK] along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine . The screen could be [MASK] by using a small [MASK] charge once the tank reached land . The [MASK] was fitted during June 1941 , as the <unk> was the lightest light tank [MASK] at the time ; the converted tank was [MASK] tested on a number of lakes and [MASK] , allowing the <unk> Drive system to be tested on [MASK] tanks , such as the [MASK] . The system would be used during [MASK] <unk> , when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the [MASK] beaches . = <unk> = <unk> , known in Japan as I Love Donald Duck : [MASK] <unk> no <unk> ( [MASK] : <unk> <unk> , Hepburn : [MASK] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> ) , is a 1991 <unk> video game [MASK] and published by Sega for the Sega [MASK] .

" = <unk> [MASK] heads = The <unk> colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone [MASK] of human heads [MASK] from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a [MASK] feature of the <unk> [MASK] of ancient <unk> . All [MASK] mature men with <unk> <unk> , flat <unk> , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical [MASK] correspond to a type that is still common among the [MASK] of <unk> and Veracruz . The backs of the [MASK] often are flat . The [MASK] were brought from the Sierra de los <unk> [MASK] of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their [MASK] were [MASK] over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and [MASK] , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful [MASK] <unk> rulers . Each of the known examples has a [MASK] headdress . The heads were [MASK] arranged in lines or groups at major <unk> centres , but the method and [MASK] used to [MASK] the stone to these sites remain unclear . The [MASK] of a colossal head at <unk> <unk> in the nineteenth century spurred the first [MASK] investigations of <unk> culture by Matthew <unk> in 1938 . [MASK] confirmed examples are known from four sites [MASK] the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Most [MASK] heads were sculpted from [MASK] boulders but two from San Lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone <unk> . An [MASK] monument , at <unk> <unk> in [MASK] , is a throne that may have been carved from a [MASK] head . This is the only known [MASK] from outside the <unk> <unk> . <unk> the [MASK] remains difficult because of the [MASK] of many from their original contexts prior to [MASK] investigation . Most have been dated to the Early <unk> [MASK] ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with some to the [MASK] <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The [MASK] weigh 6 tons , while the largest is [MASK] estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left [MASK] close to the source of its stone . = = <unk> [MASK] = = The <unk> [MASK] developed in the lowlands of [MASK] Mexico between 1500 and 400 BC . The <unk> <unk> lies on the Gulf Coast of [MASK] within the states of Veracruz and <unk> , an area measuring [MASK] 275 [MASK] ( 171 mi ) east to west and extending about 100 [MASK] ( 62 mi ) inland from the coast . The <unk> are [MASK] as the first [MASK] to develop in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is one of six <unk> of [MASK] worldwide , the others being the <unk> <unk> [MASK] of South America , the <unk> [MASK] of China 's Yellow River , the Indus Valley [MASK] of south Asia , the civilization of ancient Egypt and the <unk> [MASK] of ancient Iraq . Of these , only the <unk> [MASK] developed in a lowland tropical forest setting . The <unk> were the first [MASK] of the Americas to construct monumental [MASK] and to settle in towns and [MASK] . They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a [MASK] style of stone [MASK] . In the first decade of the 21st century [MASK] emerged of <unk> writing , with the earliest examples of <unk> [MASK] dating to around 650 BC . [MASK] of script have been found on roller stamps and stone [MASK] ; the texts are short and have been partially <unk> based on their [MASK] to other <unk> scripts . The evidence of complex society [MASK] in the <unk> <unk> has led to the <unk> being [MASK] as the " Mother Culture " of <unk> , [MASK] this concept remains [MASK] . Some of the <unk> ' rulers seem to have served [MASK] functions . The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the [MASK] by La [MASK] in about 900 BC , with <unk> <unk> and <unk> de los <unk> [MASK] sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less [MASK] . The nature and degree of the control [MASK] by the centres over a [MASK] rural population remains unclear . Very fine <unk> art , much [MASK] made for an elite , survives in several forms , notably <unk> [MASK] , and larger [MASK] such as The <unk> . The figurines have been [MASK] in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were [MASK] widely available to the population . Together with these , of [MASK] relevance to the colossal [MASK] are the " <unk> @-@ style masks " in stone , so called because none have yet been [MASK] in circumstances that allow the proper [MASK] identification of an <unk> context . These [MASK] stone face masks present both [MASK] and differences to the colossal heads . Two thirds of <unk> [MASK] sculpture represents the human form , and the [MASK] heads fall within this major theme of <unk> art . = = <unk> = = The [MASK] heads cannot be [MASK] dated . However , the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC , [MASK] that their period of [MASK] and use was earlier still . The heads from <unk> <unk> had been moved from their [MASK] context before they were investigated by [MASK] and the heads from La <unk> were found [MASK] exposed on the modern ground surface . The period of [MASK] of the colossal heads is [MASK] unknown , as is whether it spanned a century or a [MASK] . Estimates of the time span during which [MASK] heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . The San Lorenzo heads are [MASK] to be the [MASK] , and are the most <unk> [MASK] . All of the stone heads have been assigned to the <unk> period of <unk> [MASK] , generally to the [MASK] <unk> ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) , [MASK] the two <unk> <unk> heads and the La <unk> Head are [MASK] to the Middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) . = = [MASK] = = <unk> [MASK] heads vary in height from 1 @.@ 47 to 3 @.@ 4 [MASK] ( 4 @.@ 8 to 11 @.@ 2 ft ) and weigh [MASK] 6 and 50 tons . All of the <unk> [MASK] heads depict mature men with flat [MASK] and <unk> <unk> ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . The general physical [MASK] of the [MASK] are of a type that is still [MASK] among people in the <unk> region in modern times . The [MASK] of the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were [MASK] placed against a wall . All examples of <unk> colossal heads wear [MASK] <unk> that probably [MASK] cloth or animal hide originals . Some [MASK] have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some are [MASK] with feathers . A head from La <unk> is [MASK] with the head of a bird . There are [MASK] between the <unk> on some of the heads that has led to [MASK] that specific <unk> may [MASK] different dynasties , or perhaps identify [MASK] rulers . Most of the heads wear large <unk> [MASK] into the ear lobes . All of the heads are realistic , <unk> and <unk> [MASK] of the men . It is likely that they were [MASK] of living ( or [MASK] deceased ) rulers well known to the <unk> . Each head is distinct and <unk> , [MASK] <unk> features . They were once thought to [MASK] <unk> [MASK] this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they [MASK] rulers equipped for the <unk> <unk> . <unk> [MASK] depicted on the heads vary from stern [MASK] placid to smiling . The most <unk> <unk> art is the earliest , [MASK] suddenly without [MASK] <unk> , with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time [MASK] . Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El <unk> [MASK] that the <unk> are likely to have created many more <unk> [MASK] than works sculpted from stone . In the late [MASK] century , José <unk> y Serrano [MASK] a colossal head as having " Ethiopian " features and [MASK] that the <unk> had African origins [MASK] in 1960 in the work of Alfonso <unk> <unk> and in the 1970s in the [MASK] of Ivan van <unk> . Such [MASK] is not taken seriously by <unk> [MASK] such as Richard <unk> and Ann <unk> . [MASK] all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic [MASK] in their execution . One of the heads from San [MASK] bears traces of plaster and red paint , [MASK] that the heads were originally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent [MASK] <unk> rulers ; they also [MASK] the very concept of rulership itself . = = <unk> = = The [MASK] of each colossal head must have been [MASK] planned , given the effort required to ensure the [MASK] resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more [MASK] <unk> rulers were able to <unk> such [MASK] . The workforce would have included <unk> , [MASK] , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> [MASK] the tools to make and move the [MASK] , in addition to the support needed to feed and [MASK] attend to these workers . The seasonal and [MASK] cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the [MASK] of the [MASK] and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end . [MASK] investigation of <unk> basalt [MASK] suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct [MASK] to chip away both large and small <unk> of stone . The [MASK] was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> , which were [MASK] [MASK] <unk> that could be of the same basalt as the [MASK] itself , although this was not always the case . <unk> were found in [MASK] with workshops at San Lorenzo , [MASK] their use in the finishing of fine detail . <unk> colossal heads were [MASK] as in @-@ the @-@ round [MASK] with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to [MASK] higher [MASK] on the face and lower relief on the <unk> and <unk> . [MASK] 20 at San Lorenzo is an [MASK] damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was [MASK] to another location before being [MASK] . It is possible that this damage was caused by the [MASK] stages of re @-@ carving the [MASK] into a colossal head but that the work was never [MASK] . All seventeen of the [MASK] heads in the <unk> <unk> were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los <unk> [MASK] of [MASK] . Most were formed from coarse <unk> dark grey basalt known as <unk> <unk> basalt after a [MASK] in the range . <unk> have [MASK] that large <unk> <unk> basalt boulders found on the [MASK] slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the [MASK] . These [MASK] are found in an area affected by large <unk> ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried [MASK] blocks of stone down the [MASK] slopes , which suggests that the <unk> did not need to quarry the raw [MASK] for <unk> the heads . Roughly [MASK] boulders were carefully selected to [MASK] the shape of a human head . The stone for the San [MASK] and La <unk> heads was transported a [MASK] distance from the source . The La [MASK] head was found on El <unk> hill in the [MASK] de los <unk> and the stone from <unk> <unk> [MASK] Head 1 and <unk> <unk> Head 1 ( also known as <unk> <unk> [MASK] A and Q ) came from the same hill . The boulders were [MASK] over 150 [MASK] ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The exact method of [MASK] of such large masses of rock are unknown , [MASK] since the <unk> lacked <unk> of burden and [MASK] wheels , and they were likely to have used water [MASK] whenever possible . Coastal [MASK] of the Gulf of Mexico and in river [MASK] might have made the <unk> transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more [MASK] . Two badly damaged <unk> sculptures depict [MASK] stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely [MASK] human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These [MASK] may well depict <unk> rulers [MASK] the transport of the stone that would be [MASK] into their monuments . When [MASK] over land was necessary , the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> , ramps and roads to [MASK] moving the heads . The regional terrain offers [MASK] obstacles such as swamps and [MASK] ; avoiding these would have [MASK] crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful [MASK] soils would have allowed a direct route across the [MASK] to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth [MASK] such as mounds , platforms and <unk> upon the plateau [MASK] that the <unk> possessed the [MASK] knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale [MASK] . The flat backs of many of the colossal heads [MASK] the flat bases of the [MASK] <unk> from which they were reworked . Only four of the [MASK] <unk> heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the [MASK] that the majority were reworked monuments . [MASK] , the backs of many of these massive [MASK] may have been flattened to ease their transport , [MASK] a stable form for <unk> the monuments with ropes . Two heads from San [MASK] have traces of niches that are [MASK] of monumental <unk> <unk> and so were [MASK] reworked from earlier monuments . = = Known monuments = = Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An [MASK] monument , at <unk> <unk> in [MASK] , is a throne that may have been carved from a [MASK] head . This is the only known [MASK] outside of the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . [MASK] fragments of [MASK] colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San [MASK] in <unk> . <unk> colossal stone heads are also known in the [MASK] Maya area where they are [MASK] with the <unk> style of sculpture . Although some [MASK] have been made that they are pre @-@ <unk> , these latter [MASK] are generally believed to be [MASK] by the <unk> style of sculpture . = = = San [MASK] = = = The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo [MASK] formed two roughly parallel lines running north @-@ south across the site . [MASK] some were [MASK] from <unk> , they were found close to their [MASK] <unk> and had been buried by local erosion . These heads , [MASK] with a number of monumental stone <unk> , probably formed a [MASK] route across the site , [MASK] displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San [MASK] heads had been re @-@ carved from older <unk> . San [MASK] <unk> Head 1 ( also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 1 ) was lying facing upwards when [MASK] . The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument [MASK] its eye and led to the [MASK] of the <unk> site . <unk> Head 1 is 2 @.@ 84 [MASK] ( 9 @.@ 3 ft ) high ; it [MASK] 2 @.@ 11 [MASK] ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) wide and it weighs 25 @.@ 3 tons . The monument was [MASK] [MASK] buried at the edge of a gully by Matthew <unk> in 1945 . When [MASK] it was lying on its back , looking upwards . It was [MASK] with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and [MASK] . The [MASK] of these ceramic remains have been dated to [MASK] 800 and 400 BC ; some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase ( Late [MASK] period , 800 – 1000 AD ) . The [MASK] possesses a [MASK] band that is tied at the back of the head . The upper portion of the [MASK] is [MASK] with a U @-@ shaped motif . This element descends across the front of the headdress , [MASK] on the forehead . On the front portion it is [MASK] with five [MASK] motifs . The <unk> piece does not meet the [MASK] band , leaving a space between the two [MASK] . On each side of the face a strap descends from the [MASK] and passes in front of the ear . The [MASK] is wrinkled in a <unk> . The lips are slightly parted without [MASK] the teeth . The <unk> are pronounced and the ears are [MASK] well executed . The face is slightly [MASK] , which may be due to [MASK] on the part of the <unk> or may [MASK] reflect the physical features of the [MASK] 's subject . The head has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> ( " <unk> [MASK] of <unk> " ) . San [MASK] <unk> Head 2 ( also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 2 ) was reworked from a [MASK] throne . The head stands 2 @.@ 69 [MASK] ( 8 @.@ 8 ft ) high and [MASK] 1 @.@ 83 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 05 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it [MASK] 20 tons . <unk> Head 2 was [MASK] in 1945 when Matthew <unk> 's guide cleared away some of the [MASK] and mud that covered it . The [MASK] was found lying on its back , [MASK] the sky , and was [MASK] in 1946 by <unk> and Philip <unk> . In 1962 the [MASK] was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on [MASK] as part of " The <unk> tradition " [MASK] at the Museum of Fine Arts in [MASK] in 1963 . San Lorenzo <unk> Head 2 is [MASK] in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> in Mexico City . The head was [MASK] with a number of [MASK] finds ; they have been dated to the Early <unk> and Late [MASK] periods . <unk> Head 2 wears a complex headdress that sports a [MASK] band [MASK] at the back of the head ; this is [MASK] with three bird 's heads that are located above the [MASK] and temples . The <unk> piece is formed from six strips [MASK] towards the back of the head . The front of the headdress above the [MASK] band is [MASK] . Two short <unk> hang down from the [MASK] in front of the ears . The ear jewellery is [MASK] by large <unk> <unk> or framed discs . The left and right [MASK] are different , with radial lines on the left <unk> , a [MASK] absent on the right <unk> . The head is badly [MASK] due to an [MASK] reworking process . This process has <unk> the entire face with at least 60 [MASK] <unk> and 2 larger holes . The [MASK] features appear to depict an ageing man with the [MASK] <unk> into a <unk> . The lips are thick and [MASK] parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a [MASK] chin . San [MASK] <unk> Head 3 is also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 3 . The head measures 1 @.@ 78 [MASK] ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 [MASK] ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and [MASK] 9 @.@ 4 tons . The head was [MASK] in a deep gully by Matthew <unk> in 1946 ; it was [MASK] lying face down and its [MASK] was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The [MASK] was found 0 @.@ 8 [MASK] ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its [MASK] [MASK] is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in [MASK] movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been [MASK] to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . The headdress is complex , with the [MASK] basal band being formed by four [MASK] <unk> , with diagonal [MASK] above each eye . A small <unk> tops the [MASK] . A large flap formed of four <unk> drops down both sides of the head , [MASK] covering the ears . The face has a [MASK] <unk> brow and , [MASK] , has clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick and [MASK] parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away [MASK] , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 [MASK] spaced artificial [MASK] . San Lorenzo <unk> Head 4 ( also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 4 ) weighs 6 tons and has been [MASK] to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . <unk> Head 4 is 1 @.@ 78 [MASK] ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) [MASK] , 1 @.@ 17 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 95 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . The head was [MASK] by Matthew <unk> in 1946 , 550 metres ( 600 yd ) [MASK] of the [MASK] mound , at the edge of a gully . When [MASK] , it was found to be lying on its [MASK] @-@ hand side and in a very good state of [MASK] . <unk> materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics [MASK] with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument [MASK] . The headdress is decorated with a [MASK] band formed of four sculpted <unk> , [MASK] to those of Head 3 . On the right @-@ hand side , three <unk> [MASK] from the upper portion of the [MASK] ; they terminate in a total of eight [MASK] that hang down across the [MASK] band . These <unk> are judged to represent hair [MASK] than <unk> . Also on the right hand side , two <unk> descend across the ear and [MASK] to the base of the [MASK] . On the left @-@ hand side , three [MASK] <unk> descend across the ear . The <unk> is only [MASK] on the right hand side ; it is [MASK] of a plain disc and <unk> . The face is that of an [MASK] man with a <unk> forehead , low <unk> and a [MASK] chin . The lips are thick and [MASK] parted . San [MASK] <unk> Head 5 is also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 5 . The monument stands 1 @.@ 86 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) high and [MASK] 1 @.@ 47 [MASK] ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 15 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . It [MASK] 11 @.@ 6 tons . The head was [MASK] by Matthew <unk> in 1946 , face down in a [MASK] to the south of the principal mound . The head is [MASK] well executed and is [MASK] to have been found close to its original location . <unk> recovered during its [MASK] became mixed with those from the [MASK] of Head 4 . The mixed [MASK] have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases ( [MASK] 1400 – 1000 BC and 800 – 1000 AD [MASK] ) . <unk> Head 5 is [MASK] well preserved , although the back of the [MASK] band was damaged when the head was moved from the [MASK] site . The band of the headdress is set at an [MASK] and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The [MASK] is decorated with jaguar paws ; this general [MASK] of the decoration is [MASK] by <unk> de la <unk> since the " paws " have three claws each ; she [MASK] them as the [MASK] of a bird of prey . At the back of the head , ten <unk> [MASK] form a net [MASK] with disc motifs . Two short <unk> descend from the [MASK] in front of the ears . The ears are [MASK] with disc @-@ shaped <unk> with <unk> . The face is that of an [MASK] man with <unk> under the eyes and [MASK] the bridge of the nose , and a [MASK] that is <unk> in a <unk> . The lips are [MASK] parted . <unk> Head 5 has been [MASK] to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . San [MASK] <unk> Head 6 ( also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 17 ) is one of the smaller [MASK] of colossal heads , standing 1 @.@ 67 metres ( 5 @.@ 5 ft ) .

The head was [MASK] by a local <unk> and was [MASK] in 1965 by Luis <unk> and <unk> <unk> Chan . The head had [MASK] into a [MASK] under its own weight and was found face [MASK] on its left hand side . In 1970 it was transported to the [MASK] Museum of Art in New York for the museum 's centenary [MASK] . After its [MASK] to Mexico , it was placed in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> in Mexico City . It is [MASK] with a net @-@ like head [MASK] joined together with sculpted beads . A covering descends from under the [MASK] to [MASK] the back half of the neck . The <unk> is [MASK] into four strips and begins above the right ear , [MASK] around the entire head . A short strap [MASK] from either side of the head to the ear . The ear [MASK] are complex and are [MASK] at the front of the ear than at the back . The face is that of an [MASK] male with the [MASK] <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> under the eyes , <unk> <unk> and deep <unk> on [MASK] side of the nose . The face is somewhat [MASK] , possibly due to errors in the [MASK] of the [MASK] .

San [MASK] <unk> Head 7 was reworked from a [MASK] throne ; it was discovered by a joint [MASK] project by the <unk> <unk> de <unk> e Historia and Yale [MASK] , as a [MASK] of a <unk> survey . It was buried at a [MASK] of less than 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) and was lying facing [MASK] , leaning slightly [MASK] on its right hand side . The head is poorly [MASK] and has suffered both from erosion and [MASK] damage . The headdress is decorated with a pair of human hands ; a [MASK] ornament is carved at the back of the [MASK] and two discs adorn the front . A short strap [MASK] from the <unk> and [MASK] in front of the right ear . The head sports large <unk> that [MASK] cover the <unk> , although severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to [MASK] . The face has <unk> [MASK] the nose and <unk> , [MASK] <unk> and deep @-@ set eyes ; the lips are badly [MASK] and the mouth is open , displaying the teeth . In 1986 the head was [MASK] to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . San [MASK] <unk> Head 8 ( also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 61 ) [MASK] 2 @.@ 2 metres ( 7 @.@ 2 ft ) high ; it [MASK] 1 @.@ 65 [MASK] ( 5 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 6 [MASK] ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) deep and [MASK] 13 tons . It is one of the finest [MASK] of an <unk> colossal head . It was [MASK] lying on its side to the south of a [MASK] throne . The monument was discovered at a depth of 5 [MASK] ( 16 ft ) during a <unk> [MASK] of the site in 1968 ; it has been dated to the Early <unk> . After [MASK] it was [MASK] reburied ; it was moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> in 1986 . The [MASK] is decorated with the <unk> or claws of [MASK] a jaguar or an [MASK] . It has a <unk> and a cover that descends from under the [MASK] proper behind the ears . Two short <unk> [MASK] in front of the ears . The head sports large ear [MASK] in the form of <unk> . The face is that of a [MASK] male with <unk> <unk> and <unk> [MASK] these and the nose . The [MASK] is gathered in a <unk> . The mouth is [MASK] parted to reveal the teeth . Most of the head is carved in a [MASK] manner , the [MASK] being the ears . These are stylised and [MASK] by one question mark shape contained within another . The head is very well [MASK] and displays a fine finish . San [MASK] <unk> Head 9 is also known as San Lorenzo [MASK] 66 .

The original location of the La <unk> head was not a major [MASK] site and it is likely that the head was either [MASK] at its source or during transport to its intended [MASK] . Various features of the head suggest that it was [MASK] , such as a lack of [MASK] below the mouth and an area of [MASK] stone above the base . Rock was not [MASK] from around the <unk> as on other heads , and does not narrow [MASK] the base . Large parts of the [MASK] seem to be <unk> out without finished detail .

Estimates of the area in [MASK] shadow were obtained from Earth @-@ based radar [MASK] . <unk> along the rim of the crater are almost [MASK] illuminated by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit [MASK] to the Sun . <unk> [MASK] mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been [MASK] to exist since the 1900s . The [MASK] portion of the crater was <unk> with the <unk> Camera of the [MASK] <unk> spacecraft using the [MASK] of sunlight reflected off the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a [MASK] 30 ° [MASK] that leads down to a 6 @.@ 6 km [MASK] floor . The handful of craters along the [MASK] span no more than a few hundred meters . The bottom is [MASK] by an uneven mound @-@ like [MASK] that is 300 to 400 m thick . The [MASK] peak is about 200 m in height . The [MASK] shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a [MASK] that never exceeds about 100 K. For <unk> , the average [MASK] was [MASK] to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these [MASK] , the [MASK] rate of loss from any ice in the [MASK] would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . Any water vapor that [MASK] here following a <unk> impact on the Moon would lie [MASK] frozen on or below the [MASK] . However , the [MASK] albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side , [MASK] that there is no exposed surface ice . This [MASK] was named after Ernest Henry <unk> , an Anglo @-@ Irish explorer of [MASK] from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was [MASK] adopted by the [MASK] Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include [MASK] , <unk> , de <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> [MASK] away , on the eastern [MASK] of the lunar near side , are the larger [MASK] <unk> and Scott , named after two other early [MASK] of the Antarctic continent . = = [MASK] = = From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the [MASK] limb of the Moon , making [MASK] difficult . Detailed mapping of the polar [MASK] and <unk> of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting [MASK] . <unk> lies entirely within the rim of the [MASK] South Pole @-@ <unk> basin , which is one of the [MASK] known impact [MASK] in the Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an [MASK] of its properties could provide useful [MASK] about the lunar interior . A neutron <unk> on board the <unk> <unk> [MASK] detected enhanced [MASK] of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , [MASK] the crater <unk> . At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the [MASK] was crashed into the nearby crater [MASK] in the hope of detecting from Earth @-@ based [MASK] an impact @-@ generated plume [MASK] water vapor . The impact event did not produce any [MASK] water vapor , and this may be an [MASK] that the hydrogen is not in the form of [MASK] minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . [MASK] , it is possible that the crash did not [MASK] deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate [MASK] quantities of water vapor . From Earth @-@ based radar and [MASK] images of the crater edge , <unk> appears to be [MASK] intact ; much like a young crater that has not been [MASK] eroded from [MASK] impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are [MASK] steep , which may make traversing the sides [MASK] difficult for a robotic vehicle . In addition , it is [MASK] that the interior floor might not have collected a [MASK] quantity of <unk> since its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are [MASK] older , and may contain [MASK] deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice . ( See [MASK] ( lunar crater ) , for [MASK] . ) Radar studies preceding and following the <unk> <unk> mission [MASK] that the inner walls of <unk> are similar in reflective [MASK] to those of some <unk> craters . In [MASK] , the [MASK] appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its <unk> blanket , [MASK] that its radar properties are a result of [MASK] <unk> , and not ice deposits , as was [MASK] suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission . This [MASK] , however , is not [MASK] agreed upon within the scientific community . Radar images of the crater at a [MASK] of 13 cm show no [MASK] for water ice deposits . Optical [MASK] inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar <unk> [MASK] <unk> in 2007 . It did not have any evidence of [MASK] amount of water ice , down to the image [MASK] of 10 m per pixel . On [MASK] 15 , 2008 , a 34 @-@ kg probe made a hard [MASK] near the [MASK] . The moon impact probe ( <unk> ) was launched from the Indian <unk> @-@ I [MASK] and [MASK] the surface 25 minutes later . The probe carried a radar <unk> , video [MASK] system , and a mass <unk> , which will be used to [MASK] for water . = = [MASK] uses = = Some sites along <unk> 's rim receive almost constant [MASK] . At these <unk> sunlight is almost always available for [MASK] into [MASK] using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The [MASK] at this site is also more favorable than at more [MASK] latitudes as it does not experience the daily [MASK] extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is [MASK] , to as low as − 150 ° C [MASK] the lunar night . While scientific [MASK] performed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> could [MASK] the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from [MASK] . There are doubts among [MASK] as to whether or not the [MASK] is in the form of ice , as well as to the [MASK] of this " ore " with depth below the surface . [MASK] of this issue will require future [MASK] to the Moon . The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could [MASK] be " mined " for [MASK] of hydrogen in water form , a [MASK] that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth . This crater has also been [MASK] as a future site for a large infrared [MASK] . The low [MASK] of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared [MASK] , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the [MASK] . About 120 [MASK] from the crater lies the 5 @-@ km tall <unk> [MASK] , a peak that is <unk> visible from the [MASK] , and which could serve as a radio relay station when [MASK] equipped . NASA has named the rim of <unk> as a [MASK] candidate for its lunar [MASK] , slated to be up and running by <unk> and [MASK] staffed by a crew by <unk> . The location would promote self @-@ <unk> for lunar [MASK] , as [MASK] sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels . [MASK] , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water [MASK] for human [MASK] and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture . = [MASK] Beauty ( 1999 film ) = American Beauty is a 1999 [MASK] drama film directed by Sam <unk> and [MASK] by Alan Ball .

" The [MASK] critic and author Wayne C. <unk> concludes that the film <unk> any one [MASK] : " [ American Beauty ] cannot be [MASK] summarized as ' here is a satire on what 's wrong with [MASK] life ' ; that plays down the [MASK] of beauty .

It cannot be [MASK] with either Lester or Ricky 's [MASK] statements about what life is or how one should live .

He <unk> in the <unk> of his [MASK] ; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the [MASK] of many where Lester is [MASK] behind bars or within frames , such as when he is [MASK] behind columns of numbers on a [MASK] monitor , " confined [ and ] nearly crossed out " . The [MASK] and author <unk> W. <unk> argues that Lester 's [MASK] is the story 's center . His sexual <unk> [MASK] meeting Angela is the first of [MASK] turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the [MASK] of the comfortable life he has come to <unk> " . After [MASK] shares a joint with Ricky , his spirit is [MASK] and he begins to rebel [MASK] Carolyn . Changed by Ricky 's " [MASK] , profound confidence " , Lester is [MASK] that Angela is <unk> and sees that he must question his " <unk> , <unk> <unk> suburban [MASK] " ; he [MASK] a job at a fast @-@ food [MASK] , which allows him to <unk> to a [MASK] when he could " see his whole life ahead of him " . When [MASK] is caught <unk> by Carolyn , his angry <unk> about their lack of [MASK] is the first time he says aloud what he [MASK] about her . By <unk> the issue and [MASK] 's " [MASK] investments in others " , Lester is trying to " [MASK] a voice in a home that [ only [MASK] ] the voices of mother and daughter " . His final [MASK] point comes when Angela and he almost have sex ; after she [MASK] her <unk> , he no [MASK] thinks of her as a sex object , but as a [MASK] .

As he <unk> at a [MASK] photo , the camera pans slowly from Lester to the [MASK] wall , onto which blood <unk> as a [MASK] rings out ; the slow pan [MASK] the peace of Lester 's death .

The film argues the case against [MASK] , but does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay [MASK] [MASK] want to fit in . Jim and Jim , the <unk> ' other [MASK] , are a satire of " gay <unk> <unk> " , who " [ [MASK] ] in the <unk> <unk> " that the film [MASK] in [MASK] couples . The feminist academic and author <unk> R. <unk> argues that [MASK] Beauty uses its " art house " <unk> to direct its message of <unk> [MASK] to the middle classes , and that this [MASK] is a " cliché of <unk> [MASK] ; [ ... ] the [MASK] premise being that the luxury of finding an [MASK] ' self ' through denial and <unk> is always open to those [MASK] enough to choose , and <unk> enough to present [MASK] <unk> as a rebel . " [MASK] Roy M. <unk> argues that the film 's thematic center is its [MASK] to the audience to " look closer " . The opening combines an [MASK] viewpoint of the <unk> ' [MASK] with Lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing [MASK] to consider their own [MASK] and the beauty around them . It also sets a series of [MASK] ; <unk> asks , " from what place [MASK] , and from what state of being , is he [MASK] this story ? If he 's already dead , why <unk> with [MASK] it is he [MASK] to tell about his last year of being alive ? There is also the [MASK] of how Lester has died — or will die .

Through this [MASK] of Lester 's life , <unk> and death , [MASK] Beauty <unk> American middle class notions of meaning , beauty and satisfaction . Even Lester 's [MASK] only comes about because of the [MASK] of sex with Angela ; he [MASK] remains a " willing devotee of the popular media 's <unk> of <unk> male [MASK] as a sensible route to personal <unk> " . Carolyn is [MASK] driven by [MASK] views of happiness ; from her belief in " house [MASK] " domestic <unk> to her car and <unk> outfit , [MASK] 's domain is a " <unk> [MASK] <unk> vision of <unk> , or Eden " . The <unk> are [MASK] that they are " <unk> [MASK] , and devout consumers <unk> " who expect the " <unk> of American beauty " to give them [MASK] . <unk> argues that " they are [MASK] in the face of the <unk> economic and sexual [MASK] [ ... ] that they and their culture have [MASK] for their [MASK] . " The film presents Ricky as its " [MASK] , [ ... ] spiritual and mystical center " . He sees beauty in the <unk> of [MASK] life , [MASK] as much as he can for fear of missing it . He shows Jane what he [MASK] the most [MASK] thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , [MASK] in the wind in front of a wall . He says [MASK] the moment was when he realized that there was " an [MASK] life behind things " ; he feels that " [MASK] there 's so much [MASK] in the world I feel like I can 't take it ... and my [MASK] is going to cave in . " <unk> argues that Ricky , in [MASK] past the " [MASK] <unk> " , has " [ [MASK] ] the <unk> <unk> of the created world " to see God . As the film [MASK] , the <unk> move [MASK] to Ricky 's view of the world . Lester only <unk> personal [MASK] at the film 's end . On the <unk> of [MASK] sex with Angela , he [MASK] to himself after she admits her <unk> . Suddenly [MASK] with a child , he begins to treat her as a [MASK] ; in doing so , Lester sees [MASK] , Angela , and his family " for the poor and fragile but <unk> [MASK] they are " . He looks at a [MASK] of his family in <unk> times , and dies [MASK] had an <unk> that <unk> him with " [MASK] , joy , and soul @-@ shaking [MASK] " — he has finally seen the world as it is . [MASK] to Patti <unk> , colors are used [MASK] throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an [MASK] thematic [MASK] that drives the story and " [ defines ] [MASK] 's arc " . First seen in drab colors that reflect his <unk> , Lester [MASK] himself with red as he <unk> his [MASK] . The American Beauty rose is [MASK] used as symbol ; when Lester <unk> about Angela , she is usually naked and [MASK] by rose <unk> . In these [MASK] , the rose <unk> Lester 's desire for her . When [MASK] with Carolyn , the rose [MASK] a " façade for suburban success " . Roses are [MASK] in almost every shot inside the <unk> ' home , where they [MASK] " a mask [MASK] a bleak , <unk> reality " . Carolyn feels that " as long as [MASK] can be <unk> , all is well " . She cuts the [MASK] and puts them in [MASK] , where they adorn her " <unk> [MASK] of what makes for beauty " and begin to die . The [MASK] in the vase in the Angela – Lester [MASK] scene symbolize Lester 's previous life and [MASK] ; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer , [MASK] taking the <unk> — and thus [MASK] — out of the shot . Lester 's <unk> at the end of the film is [MASK] by rain and the use of red , [MASK] to a crescendo that is a [MASK] contrast to the release Lester feels . The [MASK] use of red " <unk> [ the [MASK] ] <unk> " into becoming used to it ; [MASK] , it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his [MASK] <unk> on the wall . = = = <unk> and [MASK] = = = <unk> argues that American Beauty defines its [MASK] through their sexuality . Lester 's [MASK] to relive his youth are a [MASK] result of his lust for Angela , and the state of his [MASK] with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact . Also sexually [MASK] , [MASK] has an affair that takes her from " cold [MASK] " to a more <unk> soul who " [ sings ] [MASK] along with " the music in her car . Jane and Angela [MASK] reference sex , through Angela 's [MASK] of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls [MASK] each other . Their nude scenes are used to communicate their [MASK] . By the end of the film , [MASK] 's hold on Jane has [MASK] until the only power she has over her friend is Lester 's [MASK] to her .

" To which Ricky [MASK] , " That 's the [MASK] , Dad — they don 't feel like it 's [MASK] to be <unk> of . " <unk> argues that Col. <unk> ' [MASK] is not [MASK] , but an " <unk> self @-@ <unk> " . With other turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ [MASK] films such as Fight Club , In the [MASK] of Men ( 1997 ) , [MASK] <unk> ( 2000 ) , and Boys Don 't [MASK] ( 1999 ) , [MASK] Beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue of <unk> in crisis " . [MASK] Vincent <unk> charges that in their [MASK] of <unk> " against threats posed by war , by <unk> , and by [MASK] and <unk> [MASK] " , these films present a need to " focus on , and even to [MASK] " aspects of <unk> " [MASK] ' <unk> ' " . Lester 's [MASK] conveys " that he , and not the [MASK] , has borne the brunt of [ lack of [MASK] ] " and he will not stand for being <unk> . Lester 's attempts to " strengthen [MASK] <unk> " conflict with his [MASK] as a father . Although the film [MASK] the way Lester returns to that role [MASK] , he does not become " the <unk> figure [MASK] celebrated in films like Fight Club " . <unk> [MASK] that Lester 's behavior toward Angela is " a <unk> but nearly [MASK] step toward his becoming a father again " . <unk> says the film " [MASK] affirms the importance of upholding the [MASK] against <unk> " ; a recurring theme of Ball 's work is his [MASK] of the <unk> against <unk> and [MASK] . Instead of making an overt [MASK] , American Beauty looks at how their [MASK] can lead to violence . Col. <unk> is so <unk> of his [MASK] that it drives him to [MASK] Lester . Ball said , " The movie is in part about how [MASK] is based in fear and [MASK] and about what [ they ] can do . " The film [MASK] two <unk> <unk> desires : Lester 's pursuit of Angela is a [MASK] of his lust for his own daughter , while Col. <unk> ' [MASK] is exhibited through the almost <unk> [MASK] with which he controls Ricky . [MASK] , Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by [MASK] telling him he is homosexual , while Angela 's [MASK] and submission to Lester reminds him of his [MASK] and the limits of his fantasy . Col. <unk> [MASK] Ball 's father , whose <unk> [MASK] desires led to his own <unk> . Ball rewrote Col. <unk> to delay revealing him as [MASK] , which <unk> reads as a [MASK] " <unk> of Ball 's own [MASK] @-@ <unk> fantasies " . = = = <unk> and music = = = [MASK] Beauty follows a [MASK] narrative structure , only <unk> with the displaced [MASK] scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . [MASK] the plot spans one year , the film is [MASK] by Lester at the moment of his death . [MASK] <unk> says that the plot " [MASK] [ ... ] no time [ or ] all time " , [MASK] Lester 's claim that life did not flash [MASK] his eyes , but that it " [MASK] on forever like an ocean of time " . <unk> argues that a " rhythm of [MASK] " forms the core of the film 's [MASK] . For example , two scenes have the <unk> [MASK] down to an [MASK] meal , shot from the same angle . Each image is broadly similar , with minor [MASK] in object [MASK] and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester 's new @-@ found [MASK] . Another [MASK] is the pair of scenes in which Jane and [MASK] film each other . Ricky films Jane from his [MASK] window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later for a [MASK] " <unk> and [MASK] " scene in which Jane films Ricky at a [MASK] moment . Lester 's fantasies are emphasized by <unk> and [MASK] @-@ motion shots ; <unk> uses double @-@ and @-@ triple <unk> in several [MASK] , and the score alters to make the [MASK] aware that it is [MASK] a fantasy . One example is the <unk> scene — Lester 's first [MASK] with Angela . While the <unk> [MASK] their half @-@ time routine to " On Broadway " , Lester becomes [MASK] <unk> on Angela . Time slows to [MASK] his " <unk> hypnosis " and Lester begins to <unk> that Angela 's [MASK] is for him alone . " On [MASK] " — which provides a [MASK] <unk> to the <unk> action — is replaced by discordant , <unk> music that lacks melody or [MASK] . This <unk> score is [MASK] to creating the narrative <unk> in the [MASK] ; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an [MASK] length . The effect is one that Stan Link <unk> to " [MASK] time " , [MASK] by the composer and music theorist [MASK] Kramer as music that <unk> " a single present stretched out into an enormous duration , a [MASK] infinite ' now ' that [MASK] feels like an instant " . The music is used like a [MASK] cue , so that Lester and the score are [MASK] at Angela . The sequence ends with the sudden [MASK] of " On Broadway " and <unk> time .

[MASK] the end of the film , Thomas Newman 's score features more [MASK] , creating " a disturbing tempo " that [MASK] the tension of the visuals . The [MASK] is " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " , which plays during Angela 's [MASK] of Lester . At first [MASK] , its tone clashes as the [MASK] stops . The lyrics , which speak of " [MASK] burning " , can be seen as a [MASK] for Lester 's view of Angela — " the <unk> , fantasy @-@ driven [MASK] of the ' American [MASK] ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the [MASK] , small @-@ <unk> girl who , like his wife , has <unk> [MASK] a false public self " . = = [MASK] = = = = = [MASK] = = = In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several [MASK] years writing for the [MASK] sitcoms Grace Under Fire and <unk> . He [MASK] the United Talent Agency , where his [MASK] , Andrew <unk> , suggested he write a <unk> script to " <unk> [ [MASK] ] to the town as a [MASK] " . Ball pitched three ideas to <unk> : two [MASK] romantic comedies and American Beauty , which he had [MASK] conceived as a play in the early 1990s . [MASK] the story 's lack of an easily <unk> concept , <unk> [MASK] American Beauty because he felt it was the one for [MASK] Ball had the most passion . While [MASK] the script , Ball created another [MASK] sitcom , Oh , <unk> Up . He channeled his anger and [MASK] at having to <unk> to [MASK] demands on that show — and during his <unk> on Grace Under Fire and <unk> — into [MASK] [MASK] Beauty . Ball did not expect to sell the script , [MASK] it would act as more of a calling card , but [MASK] Beauty drew interest from several [MASK] bodies . <unk> passed the script to several producers , [MASK] Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen , who took it to [MASK] . With the help of executives Glenn <unk> and Bob Cooper , and Steven [MASK] in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was [MASK] to develop the project at [MASK] ; he received <unk> from the studio — known at the time for its more [MASK] fare — that it [MASK] not " iron the [ edges ] out " . In an [MASK] move , [MASK] decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it [MASK] for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> Fox <unk> [MASK] , [MASK] Films , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , and <unk> [MASK] . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million . <unk> and Cohen [MASK] Ball throughout the film 's [MASK] , including casting and director selection . The producers met with about 20 [MASK] directors , several of whom were [MASK] " A @-@ [MASK] " at the time . Ball was not keen on the more well @-@ known [MASK] because he believed their [MASK] would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become " nervous about the content " . [MASK] , the studio [MASK] the film to Mike Nichols and Robert <unk> ; neither [MASK] . In the same year , <unk> ( then a theater [MASK] ) revived the musical <unk> in New York with fellow [MASK] Rob Marshall . Beth <unk> of the [MASK] Artists Agency arranged meetings for <unk> with studio [MASK] in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a [MASK] . <unk> came across American Beauty in a pile of eight [MASK] at <unk> 's house , and knew [MASK] that it was the one he [MASK] to make ; early in his career , he had been [MASK] by how the film Paris , Texas ( 1984 ) presented [MASK] America as a mythic [MASK] and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as [MASK] with his own childhood . <unk> later met with [MASK] ; impressed by <unk> ' [MASK] of Oliver ! and <unk> , Spielberg encouraged him to [MASK] American Beauty . <unk> found that he still had to convince [MASK] ' production executives to let him direct . He had already [MASK] the film with <unk> and Cohen , and felt they [MASK] him . Ball was also keen ; [MASK] seen <unk> , he was [MASK] with <unk> ' " keen visual sense " and [MASK] he did not make obvious choices . Ball felt that <unk> liked to look under the story 's [MASK] , a [MASK] he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty . <unk> ' [MASK] also <unk> him , because of the [MASK] role the [MASK] usually has in a theater production . Over two [MASK] — the first with Cooper , Walter <unk> , and Laurie [MASK] , the second with Cooper alone — <unk> [MASK] himself to the studio . The studio soon [MASK] <unk> with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under [MASK] Guild of America rules — $ 150 @,@ 000 . <unk> [MASK] , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's [MASK] , he only [MASK] $ 38 @,@ 000 . In June 1998 , [MASK] confirmed that it had contracted <unk> to direct the film . = = = [MASK] = = = Ball was partly inspired by two [MASK] he had in the [MASK] 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a [MASK] bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He [MASK] the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it [MASK] an " [MASK] emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became [MASK] with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial . <unk> a comic book [MASK] of the scandal , he was struck by how [MASK] it had become <unk> . He said he " felt like [MASK] was a real story underneath [ that was ] more [MASK] and way more tragic " than the story [MASK] to the public , and [MASK] to turn the idea into a play . Ball [MASK] around 40 pages , but stopped when he [MASK] it would work better as a film . He felt that [MASK] of the visual themes , and because each [MASK] 's story was .. " intensely [MASK] " , it could not be done on a stage . All the main [MASK] appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature [MASK] ; Jim and Jim [MASK] had much larger roles . Ball based Lester 's story on [MASK] of his own life . Lester 's re @-@ [MASK] of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid @-@ 30s ; like [MASK] , Ball put [MASK] his <unk> to work in jobs he hated for people he did not [MASK] . Scenes in Ricky 's household reflect Ball 's own childhood [MASK] . Ball suspected his father was [MASK] and used the idea to [MASK] Col. <unk> , a man who " gave up his chance to be [MASK] " . Ball said the [MASK] 's mix of comedy and drama was not [MASK] , but that it came <unk> from his own outlook on life . He said the [MASK] produced a <unk> [MASK] , giving each trait more impact than if they [MASK] alone . In the script that was sent to [MASK] actors and directors , Lester and Angela had sex ; by the time of [MASK] , Ball had [MASK] the scene to the final version . Ball initially [MASK] counsel from others that he change the script , [MASK] they were being <unk> ; the final <unk> to alter the scene came from [MASK] ' then @-@ president Walter <unk> . He convinced Ball by [MASK] that in Greek [MASK] , the hero " has a moment of <unk> before [ ... ] [MASK] occurs " . Ball later said his anger when [MASK] the first draft had [MASK] him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his [MASK] journey — to achieve [MASK] . <unk> and Cohen asked Ball not to [MASK] the scene right away , as they felt it would be [MASK] to make changes to the script before a [MASK] had been hired . Early drafts also included a [MASK] to Col. <unk> ' service in the Marines , a sequence that [MASK] established his homosexual <unk> . In love with [MASK] Marine , Col. <unk> sees the man die and comes to [MASK] that he is being [MASK] for the " sin " of being gay . Ball removed the [MASK] because it did not fit the [MASK] of the rest of the film — Col. <unk> was the only [MASK] to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of [MASK] from Col. <unk> ' later pass at [MASK] . Ball said he had to write it for his own [MASK] to know what [MASK] to Col. <unk> , though all that remained in later drafts was subtext . Ball remained involved [MASK] production ; he had signed a television show [MASK] deal , so had to get [MASK] from his producers to take a year off to be close to [MASK] Beauty . Ball was on @-@ set for [MASK] and to help [MASK] his script for all but two days of filming . His [MASK] <unk> scenes — in which Ricky and Jane are <unk> for [MASK] 's murder after being framed by Col. <unk> — were <unk> in post @-@ [MASK] ; the writer later felt the scenes were [MASK] , saying they were a [MASK] of his " anger and [MASK] " at the time of writing ( see " [MASK] " ) . Ball and <unk> revised the script twice [MASK] it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @-@ [MASK] . The [MASK] script features a scene in Angela 's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and [MASK] ; the scene [MASK] from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene on a [MASK] " in which the three [MASK] a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a [MASK] decision , as the [MASK] was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . The [MASK] called for two days to be spent [MASK] the crash , but only half a day was [MASK] . Ball agreed , but only if the scene could [MASK] a line of Ricky 's where he [MASK] on having once seen a dead homeless woman : " When you see [MASK] like that , it 's like God is [MASK] right at you , just for a second . And if you 're [MASK] , you can look [MASK] back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " [MASK] : " [MASK] . " Ball said , " They wanted to cut that [MASK] . They said it 's not [MASK] . I said , ' You 're out of your [MASK] mind . It 's one of the most [MASK] scenes in the movie ! ' [ ... ] If any one line is the [MASK] and soul of this movie , that is the line . " [MASK] scene was rewritten to [MASK] the loss of the freeway [MASK] ; set in a <unk> , it presents a " [MASK] point " for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky [MASK] of going with Angela . By the end of [MASK] , the script had been [MASK] 10 drafts . = = = Casting = = = <unk> had [MASK] and <unk> in mind for the leads from the beginning , but [MASK] executives were <unk> . The studio [MASK] several <unk> , including Bruce [MASK] , Kevin <unk> , or John <unk> to play [MASK] , and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play [MASK] . <unk> did not want a big star " [MASK] the film down " ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his [MASK] in the 1995 [MASK] The <unk> <unk> and Seven , and 1992 's <unk> Glen Ross . Spacey was [MASK] ; he said , " I usually play [MASK] who are very quick , very [MASK] and smart . [ ... ] I [MASK] <unk> in dark , sort of <unk> waters . This is a man [MASK] one step at a time , playing by his [MASK] . This is actually much [MASK] to me , to what I am , than those other parts . " <unk> [MASK] <unk> the role of Carolyn without the studio 's consent ; although [MASK] were upset at <unk> , by September 1998 , [MASK] had entered [MASK] with Spacey and <unk> . Spacey loosely based [MASK] 's early " <unk> " <unk> on Walter <unk> . During the film , Lester 's [MASK] improves from <unk> to toned ; Spacey worked out during [MASK] to [MASK] his body , but because <unk> shot the scenes out of [MASK] order , Spacey varied <unk> to [MASK] the stages . Before filming , <unk> and Spacey analyzed Jack <unk> 's [MASK] in The <unk> ( 1960 ) , [MASK] <unk> wanted Spacey to emulate " the way [ <unk> ] moved , the way he [MASK] , the way he was in that [MASK] and the way he was an [MASK] man and yet a special man " . [MASK] 's <unk> is a <unk> to Sunset [MASK] ( 1950 ) , which is also narrated in <unk> by a dead [MASK] . <unk> felt it evoked Lester 's — and the film 's — [MASK] . <unk> [MASK] women from her youth to inform her [MASK] : " I used to <unk> constantly . You 'd go to church and see how people present [MASK] on the [MASK] , and then be inside their house and see the [MASK] . " <unk> and a hair stylist [MASK] to create a " <unk> president <unk> " hairstyle , and <unk> and [MASK] designer <unk> <unk> researched mail @-@ order <unk> to better establish Carolyn 's [MASK] of a " [MASK] suburban manor " . To help <unk> get into [MASK] 's mindset , <unk> gave her music that he [MASK] Carolyn would like . He lent <unk> the Bobby <unk> [MASK] of the song " Don 't Rain on My Parade " , which she [MASK] and [MASK] the director to include it for a scene in which [MASK] sings in her car . For the roles of Jane , Ricky , and Angela , [MASK] gave <unk> <unk> <unk> . By [MASK] 1998 , <unk> Birch , Wes [MASK] , and Mena <unk> had been cast in the [MASK] — in Birch 's case , [MASK] the fact she was <unk> for her nude scene . As [MASK] was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus [MASK] as a minor in the United States , her [MASK] had to approve her brief <unk> scene in the movie . Child labor [MASK] and they were on the set for the [MASK] of the scene . Bentley <unk> [MASK] from top actors under the age of 25 to be [MASK] . The 2009 [MASK] My Big Break followed Bentley , and several other young [MASK] , before and after he landed the part . To prepare , <unk> [MASK] Bentley with a video camera , [MASK] the actor to film what Ricky would . Peter [MASK] and Alison <unk> were cast ( as <unk> Kane and [MASK] <unk> ) after filming began in December 1998 . <unk> gave <unk> a book of [MASK] by [MASK] <unk> . He told her , " Your [MASK] is in there somewhere . " <unk> cut much of Barbara 's dialogue , including [MASK] between Colonel <unk> and her , as he felt that what [MASK] to be said about the pair — their humanity and [MASK] — was conveyed [MASK] through their shared moments of silence . Chris Cooper plays [MASK] <unk> , Scott Bakula plays Jim <unk> , and Sam <unk> plays Jim [MASK] . Jim and Jim were [MASK] depicted as the most normal , happy — and [MASK] — couple in the film . Ball 's [MASK] for the characters came from a [MASK] he had after seeing a " bland , boring , [MASK] couple " who wore matching clothes : " I can 't [MASK] for the time when a gay [MASK] can be just as boring . " Ball also [MASK] aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same <unk> . <unk> [MASK] on two weeks of cast [MASK] , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the [MASK] , and the actors could not be [MASK] at every one . Several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were [MASK] into the script . An early scene [MASK] the <unk> leaving home for work was [MASK] later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester 's [MASK] had reached . [MASK] and <unk> worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and [MASK] once had for one [MASK] ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost <unk> [MASK] after the pair argues over Lester 's buying a car was originally " strictly [MASK] " . = = = Filming = = = Principal [MASK] lasted about 50 days from [MASK] 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 . American Beauty was filmed on [MASK] at the Warner Bros. <unk> in Burbank , [MASK] , and at [MASK] Park and <unk> in Los Angeles . The aerial shots at the [MASK] and end of the film were captured in <unk> , [MASK] , and many of the [MASK] scenes were shot at South High School in <unk> , [MASK] ; several extras in the gym crowd were South High [MASK] . The film is set in an upper middle @-@ class [MASK] in an unidentified American town . [MASK] designer <unk> <unk> likened the <unk> to <unk> , [MASK] , but said , " it 's not [MASK] a place , it 's about an <unk> . [ ... ] The [MASK] was pretty much <unk> , USA — <unk> [MASK] <unk> . " The intent was for the setting to reflect the [MASK] , who are also [MASK] . <unk> said , " All of them are very [MASK] , and their lives are <unk> . " The <unk> ' [MASK] was designed as the reverse of the <unk> ' — the former a [MASK] ideal , but <unk> and [MASK] in " inner balance " , [MASK] to Carolyn 's desire to at least give it the [MASK] of a " perfect all @-@ American [MASK] " ; the <unk> ' home is depicted in " [MASK] darkness [ and ] symmetry " . The [MASK] selected two adjacent properties on the Warner <unk> 's " <unk> [MASK] " for the <unk> and <unk> ' homes . The crew rebuilt the houses to [MASK] false rooms that [MASK] lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's [MASK] windows , and between Ricky 's [MASK] and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed [MASK] to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. <unk> — [MASK] from Ricky 's bedroom — [MASK] assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . <unk> made sure to [MASK] the line of [MASK] early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of [MASK] with the shot . The house [MASK] were filmed on the <unk> , on location , and on [MASK] when overhead shots were [MASK] . The inside of the <unk> ' home was shot at a house close to [MASK] 405 and Sunset [MASK] in Los Angeles ; the inside of the <unk> ' home was shot in the city 's [MASK] Park [MASK] . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his " <unk> " [MASK] , while at the same time [MASK] with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his <unk> side . The [MASK] [MASK] <unk> the use of red , as it was an [MASK] thematic signature elsewhere . The <unk> ' home uses cool [MASK] , while the <unk> ' is kept in a " [MASK] military palette " . <unk> ' [MASK] visual style was deliberate and composed , with a <unk> design that [MASK] " a sparse , almost surreal [MASK] — a bright , <unk> , hard edged , near <unk> @-@ like take on [MASK] <unk> " ; <unk> [MASK] directed his set <unk> to empty the frame . He made Lester 's [MASK] scenes " more fluid and [MASK] " , and <unk> made minimal use of <unk> , feeling that stable shots [MASK] more tension . For [MASK] , when <unk> used a slow push in to the <unk> ' [MASK] table , he held the shot because his [MASK] as a theater director taught him the [MASK] of putting distance between the characters . He wanted to keep the [MASK] in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the [MASK] . <unk> did use a hand @-@ held [MASK] for the [MASK] in which Col. <unk> beats Ricky . <unk> said the camera [MASK] the scene with a " <unk> [ ... ] off @-@ [MASK] energy " . He also went hand @-@ held for the [MASK] of Ricky 's <unk> [MASK] . <unk> took a long time to get the [MASK] of Ricky 's footage to the level he wanted . For the [MASK] @-@ bag footage , <unk> used wind [MASK] to move the bag in the air . The [MASK] took four takes ; two by the second unit did not [MASK] <unk> , so he shot the scene [MASK] . He felt his first take lacked grace , but for the last [MASK] , he changed the [MASK] to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground . <unk> was [MASK] by the way the wall gave [MASK] to the outline of the bag . <unk> [MASK] using close @-@ ups , as he believed the [MASK] was <unk> ; he also cited [MASK] 's advice that he should imagine an audience <unk> at the bottom of the camera [MASK] , to keep in mind that he was [MASK] for display on a 40 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) [MASK] . [MASK] — who visited the set a few times — also [MASK] <unk> not to worry about costs if he had a " great idea " [MASK] the end of a long [MASK] day . <unk> said , " That [MASK] three or four times , and they are all in the movie . " Despite [MASK] 's support , [MASK] and <unk> fought constantly over the schedule and budget , [MASK] the studio <unk> little with the film 's content . Spacey , <unk> and Hall worked for [MASK] less than their usual rates . American Beauty cost [MASK] $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their [MASK] sum . <unk> was so [MASK] with his first three days ' filming that he obtained [MASK] from DreamWorks to <unk> the scenes . He said , " I [MASK] with a wrong scene , [MASK] , a comedy scene . And the [MASK] played it way too big : [ ... ] it was [MASK] shot , my fault , badly [MASK] , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ ... ] ; and [MASK] was doing what I was [MASK] . It was all my fault . " Aware that he was a [MASK] , <unk> drew on the [MASK] of Hall : " I made a very [MASK] decision early on , if I didn 't understand something technically , to say , without [MASK] , ' I don 't [MASK] what you 're talking about , please explain it . ' " <unk> [MASK] some [MASK] ; for example , when Lester <unk> in bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to [MASK] [MASK] <unk> for the act in each take . <unk> said , " I wanted that not just [MASK] it was funny [ ... ] but [MASK] I didn 't want it to seem <unk> . I [MASK] it to seem like he was [MASK] it out of his mouth without [MASK] . [ Spacey ] is so in control — I wanted him to break [MASK] . " Spacey obliged , [MASK] coming up with 35 phrases , but <unk> could not always keep a [MASK] face , which [MASK] the scene had to be shot 10 times . The [MASK] used small amounts of computer @-@ generated imagery . Most of the rose <unk> in Lester 's [MASK] were added in post @-@ [MASK] , although some were real and had the wires holding them [MASK] removed . When [MASK] <unk> about Angela in a rose @-@ <unk> bath , the [MASK] was real , save for in the [MASK] shot . To position the camera , a hole had to be cut in the [MASK] , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added [MASK] . = = = Editing = = = [MASK] Beauty was edited by [MASK] <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; <unk> began in the [MASK] , but had to leave halfway through post @-@ [MASK] because of a scheduling conflict with Me , [MASK] and Irene ( 2000 ) ( in which Chris Cooper also [MASK] ) . <unk> and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the [MASK] . <unk> realized during editing that the film was [MASK] from the one he had [MASK] . He believed he had been making a " much more [MASK] , [ ... ] <unk> " film than what came [MASK] in the edit suite . [MASK] , <unk> was drawn to the emotion and [MASK] ; he began to use the score and shots he had [MASK] to <unk> to craft the film [MASK] these lines . In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his [MASK] edit . The opening [MASK] a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town . <unk> spent two days [MASK] Spacey against <unk> , but removed the [MASK] as he believed it to be too [MASK] — " like a <unk> brothers movie " — and therefore [MASK] for the tone he was trying to set . The [MASK] in the final cut [MASK] a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her [MASK] . This scene was to be the [MASK] to the audience that the pair was not [MASK] for Lester 's death , as the way it was [MASK] and acted made it clear that Jane 's [MASK] was not serious . [MASK] , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full [MASK] plays out later — <unk> used the score and a [MASK] shot of Ricky to leave a [MASK] ambiguity as to his guilt . The subsequent shot — an aerial view of the [MASK] — was [MASK] intended as the plate shot for the <unk> effects in the dream [MASK] . <unk> spent more time <unk> the first 10 [MASK] than the rest of the film taken [MASK] . He <unk> several versions of the opening ; the first edit [MASK] <unk> scenes in which Jane and Ricky are [MASK] of Lester 's murder , but [MASK] <unk> these in the last week of [MASK] because he felt they made the film lose its [MASK] , and because they did not fit with the theme of [MASK] that had emerged during production . <unk> believed the trial drew focus away from the [MASK] and turned the film " into an [MASK] of <unk> Blue " . [MASK] , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and [MASK] [MASK] " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with [MASK] versions of these [MASK] . He felt that they were so short that they " didn 't really [MASK] " . <unk> and he argued , but Ball was more [MASK] after <unk> cut the sequences [MASK] ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more [MASK] and had evolved into [MASK] that " for all its darkness had a really [MASK] heart " . = = = <unk> = = = [MASK] Hall was not the first choice for director of [MASK] ; <unk> believed he was " too old and too [MASK] " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was [MASK] to work with . [MASK] , <unk> asked Fred <unk> , who turned the job down [MASK] he did not like the script . Hall was [MASK] to <unk> by Tom Cruise , [MASK] of Hall 's work on Without <unk> ( 1998 ) , which Cruise had [MASK] produced . <unk> was [MASK] Cruise 's then @-@ wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during <unk> on [MASK] Beauty , and had [MASK] <unk> the whole film . Hall was [MASK] for one month during <unk> ; his ideas for [MASK] the film began with his first reading of the script , and [MASK] passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting <unk> . Hall was [MASK] concerned that audiences would not like the [MASK] ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast [MASK] , which gave him fresh ideas on his [MASK] to the visuals . Hall 's [MASK] was to create peaceful [MASK] that evoked <unk> , to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events and allow [MASK] to take in the action . Hall and <unk> first [MASK] the intended mood of a scene , but he was [MASK] to light the shot in any way he felt [MASK] . In most [MASK] , Hall first lit the scene 's subject by " [MASK] in " the blacks and whites , before adding fill light , which he [MASK] from <unk> or white card on the ceiling . This [MASK] gave Hall more [MASK] over the shadows while keeping the fill [MASK] <unk> and the dark areas free of spill . Hall shot [MASK] Beauty in a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 [MASK] ratio in the Super 35 format , using <unk> [MASK] <unk> <unk> 35 mm film stock . He used Super 35 partly [MASK] its larger scope allowed him to capture [MASK] such as the corners of the <unk> @-@ filled pool in its [MASK] shot , creating a frame [MASK] Angela within . He shot the whole film at the same T @-@ stop ( [MASK] ) ; given his [MASK] for shooting that wide , Hall [MASK] high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle [MASK] effects . He used <unk> Platinum cameras with the [MASK] 's <unk> series of prime and <unk> lenses . Hall [MASK] <unk> Vision <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> stock for scenes with daylight effects . He had [MASK] adjusting to <unk> 's newly [MASK] Vision release print stock , which , [MASK] with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style , created a look with too much [MASK] . Hall [MASK] <unk> , who sent him a batch of <unk> that was 5 % lower in [MASK] . Hall used a 1 / 8 inch <unk> Black <unk> [MASK] for [MASK] every scene , which he said in <unk> may not have been the best choice , as the [MASK] steps [MASK] to blow Super 35 up for its <unk> release print led to a slight amount of [MASK] ; [MASK] , the <unk> from the filter was not required . When he saw the film in a [MASK] , Hall felt that the image was [MASK] unclear and that had he not used the [MASK] , the <unk> from the Super 35 – <unk> [MASK] would have generated an image closer to what he [MASK] intended . A shot where Lester and Ricky share a [MASK] joint behind a building came from a [MASK] between Hall and <unk> . <unk> asked Hall to [MASK] the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the [MASK] would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow [MASK] between a truck and the building , [MASK] to light from the top of the truck . When <unk> [MASK] , he explained that the [MASK] did not care if they were seen . He [MASK] the truck and Hall had to rethink the [MASK] ; he lit it from the left , with a large light [MASK] the actors , and with a soft light [MASK] the camera . Hall felt the [MASK] wide shot " worked perfectly for the tone of the [MASK] " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the [MASK] of it , in every [MASK] near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester 's [MASK] with Angela at the <unk> ' home , Hall created rain effects on the [MASK] cross lights ; in [MASK] , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added [MASK] to make the rain run slower , [MASK] the light ( although the strength of the outside light was [MASK] for a night scene , Hall felt it [MASK] because of the strong [MASK] it produced ) . For the close @-@ ups when [MASK] and Angela move to the [MASK] , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , [MASK] through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester .

He used the [MASK] of Rio <unk> chairman , Viscount <unk> , to become the [MASK] of a mobile unit of the [MASK] Red Cross . He arrived in France in [MASK] 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for [MASK] or marking the location of [MASK] of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an [MASK] within the Red Cross for this [MASK] . In March 1915 , with the support of <unk> <unk> , <unk> @-@ [MASK] of the British [MASK] Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the [MASK] War Office and the unit was [MASK] to the British Army as the Graves <unk> [MASK] . The new Graves <unk> Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers [MASK] by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 [MASK] by May 1916 . When municipal <unk> began to <unk> Ware began [MASK] with various local [MASK] to acquire land for further <unk> . Ware began with an [MASK] with France to build joint British and French <unk> under the [MASK] that these would be [MASK] by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the [MASK] [MASK] solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to [MASK] the land , grant it in <unk> , and leave the management and maintenance [MASK] to the British . The French [MASK] agreed under the condition that <unk> respected certain [MASK] , were accessible by public road , were in the [MASK] of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or [MASK] . Similar [MASK] were started with the Belgian government . As reports of the grave [MASK] work became public , the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for [MASK] of graves from [MASK] of deceased soldiers . By 1917 , 17 @,@ 000 [MASK] had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the [MASK] , with the support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch [MASK] prints and cemetery location [MASK] in answer to the requests . The Graves <unk> Commission became the [MASK] of Graves <unk> and <unk> in the spring of 1916 in [MASK] of the fact that the [MASK] of work began to extend beyond simple grave [MASK] and began to include responding to <unk> from [MASK] of those killed . The <unk> 's work was also [MASK] beyond the Western Front and into other [MASK] of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and [MASK] . = = = Formal [MASK] = = = As the war continued , Ware and others became [MASK] about the fate of the graves in the post @-@ war period . Following a [MASK] by the British Army , the National [MASK] for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was [MASK] by the British [MASK] in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as [MASK] . The National Committee for the Care of [MASK] ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the [MASK] of [MASK] <unk> and <unk> after the war . The government felt that it was more [MASK] to <unk> the work to a [MASK] appointed body rather than to any existing [MASK] department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial [MASK] would be [MASK] to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware [MASK] a [MASK] to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial [MASK] be constituted . The suggestion was [MASK] and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was [MASK] by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales serving as [MASK] , Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as [MASK] and Ware as vice @-@ chairman . The Commission 's [MASK] began in earnest at the end of the [MASK] World War . Once land for <unk> and memorials had been [MASK] , the enormous task of [MASK] the details of the dead could begin . By 1918 , some <unk> @,@ 000 [MASK] had been [MASK] and a further <unk> @,@ 000 casualties were [MASK] as having no known grave . The scale , and [MASK] high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the [MASK] of war dead . Previous to World War I , individual [MASK] of war dead was [MASK] on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to [MASK] officers . However , the war required <unk> of a [MASK] percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through [MASK] . An expectation had [MASK] arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be [MASK] , even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military . A [MASK] under <unk> Kenyon , Director of the British Museum , [MASK] a report to the [MASK] in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the [MASK] of the <unk> . Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be [MASK] and that uniform [MASK] should be used to avoid class [MASK] . Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses , it was felt that [MASK] would conflict with the feeling of <unk> that had [MASK] between serving ranks . An article in The Times on 17 [MASK] 1919 by <unk> Kipling carried the [MASK] 's proposal to a wider audience and [MASK] what the graves would look like . The article [MASK] War Graves : Work of Imperial Commission : Mr. Kipling 's Survey was quickly [MASK] as an [MASK] booklet , Graves of the Fallen . The [MASK] booklet was intended to <unk> the impact of Kenyon 's report as it included [MASK] of <unk> with mature trees and shrubs ; [MASK] the bleak landscapes depicted in published [MASK] photos . There was an immediate public <unk> following the publication of the reports , [MASK] with regards to the [MASK] to not <unk> the bodies of the dead . The reports generated [MASK] discussion in the press which [MASK] led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920 . Sir James <unk> [MASK] the debate , [MASK] by speeches by William <unk> @-@ <unk> in favour of the [MASK] 's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those <unk> [MASK] and opposing <unk> of grave markers .

In 1920 , the Commission built three [MASK] <unk> at Le <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , following the [MASK] outlined in the Kenyon report . Of these , the <unk> [MASK] Cemetery and <unk> was agreed to be the most [MASK] . Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll , the [MASK] created a walled [MASK] with uniform <unk> in a garden setting , [MASK] by <unk> 's Cross of <unk> and <unk> ' Stone of [MASK] . After some adjustments , <unk> became the template for the [MASK] 's building programme . <unk> were required because all three [MASK] <unk> went over budget . To ensure future <unk> [MASK] within their budget the [MASK] decided to not build shelters in <unk> that [MASK] less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of [MASK] in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height of [MASK] walls to 1 [MASK] ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . At the end of 1919 , the [MASK] had spent £ 7 @,@ 500 , and this [MASK] rose to £ 250 @,@ 000 in 1920 as [MASK] of <unk> and memorials increased . By 1921 , the [MASK] had [MASK] 1 @,@ 000 <unk> which were ready for <unk> <unk> , and [MASK] . Between 1920 and 1923 , the [MASK] was shipping 4 @,@ 000 <unk> a week to [MASK] . In many cases small <unk> were closed and the graves [MASK] in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of [MASK] had been completed , over 500 [MASK] had been built , with 400 @,@ 000 <unk> , a [MASK] Crosses of <unk> , and 400 Stones of [MASK] . The Commission had also been mandated to [MASK] commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which [MASK] to 315 @,@ 000 in France and Belgium alone . The [MASK] initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to [MASK] the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an [MASK] battle along the Western Front . After [MASK] from the French committee [MASK] for the <unk> of memorials on French territory , the [MASK] revised their plan and reduced the number of [MASK] , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing <unk> rather than as separate [MASK] . [MASK] <unk> 's <unk> Gate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be [MASK] , and was [MASK] on 24 July 1927 . The <unk> Gate ( <unk> ) was found to have [MASK] space to contain all the names as [MASK] planned and 34 @,@ <unk> names of the missing were instead [MASK] on Herbert Baker 's <unk> <unk> [MASK] to the Missing . Other [MASK] followed : the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James <unk> ; the <unk> [MASK] on the Somme and the <unk> [MASK] designed by Edwin <unk> ; and the Basra [MASK] in Iraq designed by Edward <unk> Warren . The <unk> and India also erected [MASK] on which they [MASK] their missing : the <unk> @-@ <unk> [MASK] for the forces of India , the <unk> Memorial by Canada , the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial by [MASK] , the <unk> Wood [MASK] by South Africa and the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Memorial by [MASK] . The programme of [MASK] the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the [MASK] of the <unk> Memorial in 1932 , though the <unk> [MASK] would not be finished until 1936 , the <unk> @-@ <unk> [MASK] until 1938 and <unk> were still [MASK] work on the <unk> Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 . The only [MASK] created by the [MASK] that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the <unk> [MASK] at <unk> , Egypt — [MASK] with library , and <unk> and pathology [MASK] — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel [MASK] Corps . Its erection was agreed with local [MASK] pressure . = = = [MASK] War II = = = From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the [MASK] organised grave [MASK] units and , planning ahead based on the [MASK] gained from the First World War , earmarked land for use as <unk> . When the war began [MASK] in favour of the Allies , the [MASK] was able to begin [MASK] its First World War <unk> and memorials . It also began the task of [MASK] the 600 @,@ 000 [MASK] casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the [MASK] completed <unk> Canadian War Cemetery , the [MASK] of <unk> new <unk> and 36 new memorials . [MASK] , over 350 @,@ 000 new <unk> were [MASK] . Many were made from <unk> Wood stone . The wider scale of World War II , [MASK] with manpower [MASK] and unrest in some countries , meant that the [MASK] and restoration programmes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission [MASK] a five @-@ year <unk> [MASK] programme . The <unk> neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary [MASK] repairs to be made . These , [MASK] with the <unk> of [MASK] tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the [MASK] was not completed until the 1960s . With the [MASK] number of civilian [MASK] compared with the World War I , Winston Churchill agreed to Ware 's proposal that the [MASK] also maintain a record of [MASK] civilian war deaths . A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves [MASK] 's charter on 7 February 1941 , <unk> the [MASK] to collect and record the names of [MASK] who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which [MASK] in the [MASK] of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour .

The [MASK] and the Dean of [MASK] reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in [MASK] Abbey but not until the roll was complete and [MASK] had ended .

Many <unk> are for [MASK] casualties ; they [MASK] bear only what could be discovered from the body . The <unk> , [MASK] by <unk> Kipling , that appears on the graves of [MASK] soldiers for which no [MASK] are known is " A Soldier of the [MASK] War known <unk> God " . Some <unk> bear the text " [MASK] to be buried in this [MASK] " when they are believed to be buried in the [MASK] but the exact location of the grave is not known . In some cases [MASK] were buried in collective graves and [MASK] one body from another was not [MASK] and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave . The <unk> does not denote any [MASK] details of the death [MASK] for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are [MASK] [MASK] about the cause of death . Due to local [MASK] it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its [MASK] design . In places prone to extreme weather or [MASK] , such as Thailand and Turkey , stone @-@ faced [MASK] markers are used instead of the normal <unk> . These [MASK] are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during [MASK] or sinking into <unk> ground . In Italy <unk> were carved from <unk> <unk> [MASK] because it was in more [MASK] supply .

During World War II , [MASK] served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the [MASK] Theatre , [MASK] virtually all naval traffic into and out of the [MASK] Sea from the Atlantic Ocean . In addition to its [MASK] position , Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the [MASK] and the [MASK] .

On 18 September 96 , <unk> was [MASK] in a palace [MASK] involving members of the <unk> Guard and several of his [MASK] . On the same day , <unk> was [MASK] emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate [MASK] a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman [MASK] , he vowed to restore [MASK] which had been curtailed during the <unk> [MASK] of <unk> . <unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial [MASK] and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army .

[MASK] sources report the date as either 30 or 35 . He had at least one [MASK] sister , named <unk> , who [MASK] Lucius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the [MASK] of the future Emperor <unk> . Like <unk> , the [MASK] of the <unk> dynasty , <unk> was a member of the Italian [MASK] rather than one of the elite of Rome . [MASK] , the <unk> were among the most esteemed and [MASK] political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attaining <unk> in each [MASK] [MASK] . The direct ancestors of <unk> on his father 's side , all named [MASK] <unk> <unk> , were [MASK] with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – AD 14 ) . His [MASK] @-@ [MASK] was Consul in 36 BC ( in replacement , and [MASK] ) , and Governor of Asia in the same year . His [MASK] became Consul <unk> in July of [MASK] 21 or 22 , and was known as a [MASK] friend of Emperor <unk> ( AD 14 – 37 ) , [MASK] the emperor during his voluntary [MASK] on Capri from 23 onwards , dying in 33 . <unk> 's father , finally , [MASK] the <unk> in 40 under [MASK] <unk> ( 37 – 41 ) . The <unk> were [MASK] with the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty through the [MASK] of <unk> <unk> 's brother <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the great @-@ [MASK] of <unk> . = = = [MASK] service = = = Not much of <unk> 's early life or [MASK] is [MASK] , but it appears he did not pursue the usual [MASK] or military career . He was <unk> @-@ [MASK] in the year 65 and , like his [MASK] , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and [MASK] . As an advisor to Emperor <unk> , he [MASK] helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy of 65 . <unk> what his contribution to the [MASK] was is not known but his services must have been [MASK] , since they earned him [MASK] equal to those of <unk> 's guard prefect <unk> . He [MASK] <unk> honors — which was usually reserved for military [MASK] — and the right to have his statues placed [MASK] the palace . According to the [MASK] poet Martial , <unk> also held <unk> 's literary [MASK] in high esteem , <unk> him as the " [MASK] of our time " . Another [MASK] member of <unk> 's entourage was <unk> , an old and respected general who had [MASK] military <unk> during the 40s . It appears <unk> [MASK] <unk> during his time as an [MASK] advisor , and may have asked him to watch over <unk> 's [MASK] son <unk> when <unk> [MASK] for the Jewish war in 67 . The [MASK] of <unk> on 9 June 68 brought the Julio @-@ <unk> [MASK] to an end , leading to the [MASK] Year of the Four <unk> , which saw the [MASK] rise and fall of the emperors <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , until the [MASK] of <unk> on 21 [MASK] 69 . <unk> nothing is known of <unk> 's [MASK] during 69 , but despite the fact that <unk> was his [MASK] @-@ in @-@ law , he appears to have been one of the earliest and [MASK] [MASK] of the <unk> . For services unknown , he was [MASK] with a <unk> early in <unk> 's reign in 71 . This was a [MASK] honour , not only [MASK] he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an [MASK] <unk> ( instead of a less [MASK] <unk> <unk> ) , [MASK] him one of the few non @-@ <unk> to be [MASK] in this way under <unk> . After 71 <unk> again [MASK] from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an [MASK] advisor under <unk> ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons [MASK] ( 79 – 81 ) and [MASK] ( 81 – 96 ) . He re @-@ [MASK] during the revolt of <unk> in 89 . On 1 January , 89 , the [MASK] of <unk> [MASK] , Lucius Antonius <unk> , and his two [MASK] at <unk> , <unk> XIV <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> [MASK] the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the <unk> .

The <unk> <unk> were sent to the front of <unk> , while those who had [MASK] in their defeat were duly rewarded . <unk> opened the year [MASK] the revolt by [MASK] the <unk> with <unk> . Again , the honour [MASK] <unk> had played a part in [MASK] the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> [MASK] under <unk> . [MASK] , <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to [MASK] the stability and status @-@ <unk> of the regime . The revolt had been [MASK] , and the Empire could return to order . = = [MASK] = = = = = [MASK] = = = On 18 September , 96 , <unk> was [MASK] in a palace [MASK] organised by court officials . The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> [MASK] , records that the same day the Senate [MASK] Marcus <unk> <unk> emperor . Despite his political [MASK] , this was a remarkable choice . <unk> was old and [MASK] , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , [MASK] both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his [MASK] in <unk> 's [MASK] . According to <unk> <unk> , the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the [MASK] , which [MASK] that he was at least aware of the plot . <unk> by [MASK] does not mention <unk> , but he may have [MASK] his role out of <unk> . [MASK] the works of <unk> were published under <unk> 's direct [MASK] Trajan and <unk> , it would have been less than [MASK] of him to suggest the dynasty owed its [MASK] to murder . On the other hand , <unk> lacked [MASK] support in the Empire , and as a known <unk> [MASK] his track record would not have recommended him to the [MASK] . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern [MASK] believe <unk> was [MASK] Emperor solely on the initiative of the [MASK] , within hours after the news of the [MASK] broke . Although he appeared to be an unlikely [MASK] on account of his age and weak health , <unk> was [MASK] a safe choice precisely because he was old and <unk> . [MASK] , he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and [MASK] the respect of a [MASK] part of the Senate . <unk> had seen the anarchy which had [MASK] from the death of <unk> ; he knew that to [MASK] even for a few hours could lead to violent civil [MASK] . Rather than decline the [MASK] and risk <unk> , he accepted . The [MASK] may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but [MASK] the Senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved in the [MASK] against <unk> . Following the [MASK] of <unk> as emperor , the Senate passed <unk> <unk> on <unk> : his coins and [MASK] were [MASK] , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . In many [MASK] , existing [MASK] of <unk> , such as those found on the <unk> <unk> , were [MASK] <unk> to fit the likeness of <unk> . This allowed quick [MASK] of new images and [MASK] of previous material . In addition , the vast palace which <unk> had [MASK] on the <unk> Hill , known as the <unk> [MASK] , was [MASK] the " House of the People " , and <unk> himself took up [MASK] in <unk> 's former villa in the Gardens of <unk> . = = = [MASK] = = = The change of government was welcome [MASK] to the <unk> , who had been harshly [MASK] during <unk> 's reign . As an [MASK] gesture of goodwill towards his [MASK] , <unk> publicly <unk> that no <unk> would be put to death as long as he [MASK] in [MASK] . He called an end to trials based on treason , released those who had been [MASK] under these [MASK] , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled . All properties which had been [MASK] by <unk> were returned to their [MASK] families . <unk> also sought to involve the Senate in his [MASK] , but this was not entirely [MASK] . He continued to rely largely on friends and [MASK] that were known and trusted , and by [MASK] friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction of the Senate , he incurred [MASK] which may have been the cause for at least one [MASK] against his life . Having been [MASK] emperor solely on the [MASK] of the Senate , <unk> had to introduce a number of [MASK] to gain support among the Roman [MASK] . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was [MASK] to bring with it a [MASK] payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . [MASK] , a <unk> of 75 <unk> per head was [MASK] upon the citizens , while the [MASK] of the <unk> Guard received a <unk> which may have [MASK] to as much as 5000 <unk> per person . This was [MASK] by a string of economic reforms intended to [MASK] the burden of taxation from the most <unk> Romans . To the [MASK] , <unk> granted <unk> of land worth up to 60 [MASK] <unk> . He <unk> parents and their children from a 5 % [MASK] tax , and he made loans to Italian [MASK] on the [MASK] that they pay interest of 5 % to their [MASK] to support the children of <unk> families ; <unk> schemes which were later [MASK] by Trajan , <unk> Pius , and Marcus Aurelius . [MASK] , numerous taxes were <unk> and [MASK] granted to Roman provinces . <unk> , he probably abolished the <unk> <unk> , the [MASK] tax which all Jews [MASK] the Empire had to pay : some of his coins bear the [MASK] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( abolition of malicious [MASK] regarding the Jewish tax ) . Before long , <unk> 's [MASK] strained the economy of Rome and , [MASK] perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> , [MASK] the formation of a special commission of economy to [MASK] reduce <unk> . The most [MASK] religious sacrifices , games and horse races were [MASK] , while new income was generated from <unk> 's former [MASK] , including the <unk> of ships , estates , and even [MASK] . Large amounts of money were [MASK] from <unk> 's silver and gold [MASK] , and <unk> forbade that similar images be made in his honor . [MASK] he reigned only briefly , <unk> 's public works were few , instead [MASK] projects which had been [MASK] under <unk> rule . This included [MASK] repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the <unk> . The latter [MASK] was headed by the [MASK] consul <unk> Julius <unk> , who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a [MASK] work on Rome 's water [MASK] , De <unk> <unk> <unk> . The only major landmarks [MASK] under <unk> were a [MASK] , known as the <unk> <unk> , and a small [MASK] <unk> begun by <unk> , which linked the <unk> of [MASK] to the Temple of Peace . Little [MASK] , partly because the Via <unk> <unk> <unk> cuts across it . = = = Crisis of [MASK] = = = Despite <unk> 's [MASK] to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , [MASK] for <unk> [MASK] strong in the army , which had called for his <unk> immediately after the [MASK] . In an attempt to appease the [MASK] of the <unk> Guard , <unk> had [MASK] their prefect Titus <unk> <unk> — one of the chief [MASK] against <unk> — and replaced him with a former [MASK] , <unk> <unk> . Likewise , the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers [MASK] his accession was [MASK] to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . The <unk> considered these measures [MASK] , however , and demanded the [MASK] of <unk> 's assassins , which <unk> refused . Continued [MASK] with this state of affairs would [MASK] lead to the <unk> crisis of <unk> 's reign . While the swift [MASK] of power [MASK] <unk> 's death had prevented a civil war from <unk> , <unk> 's [MASK] as an emperor soon proved too [MASK] , and his benign nature turned into a [MASK] to assert his authority . Upon his accession , he had [MASK] a halt to treason trials , but at the same time allowed the [MASK] of <unk> by the Senate to [MASK] . This measure led to chaos , as everyone acted in his own [MASK] while trying to settle scores with [MASK] enemies , leading the consul <unk> to famously remark that <unk> 's <unk> was [MASK] <unk> to <unk> 's [MASK] . Early in 97 , a [MASK] led by the senator <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> failed , but once again <unk> [MASK] to put the [MASK] to death , much to the disapproval of the Senate . The situation was further [MASK] by the absence of a clear [MASK] , made more pressing because of <unk> 's old age and [MASK] . He had no natural [MASK] of his own and only distant [MASK] , who were unsuited for political office . A [MASK] would have to be chosen from among the governors or [MASK] in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 , <unk> was [MASK] to adopt Marcus Cornelius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the [MASK] governor of Syria . This was covertly opposed by those who [MASK] the more popular military [MASK] Marcus <unk> <unk> , commonly known as Trajan , a [MASK] of the armies at the German [MASK] . In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the [MASK] Guard , led by <unk> <unk> , laid siege to the [MASK] Palace and took <unk> [MASK] . He was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those [MASK] for <unk> 's death and even giving a speech <unk> the [MASK] <unk> . Titus <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> 's [MASK] <unk> , were [MASK] out and killed . <unk> was unharmed in this assault , but his [MASK] was damaged beyond repair . He [MASK] that his position was no longer <unk> [MASK] the support of an heir who had the [MASK] of both the army and the people . Shortly [MASK] , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his [MASK] , and with this decision all but abdicated . Trajan was [MASK] bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the <unk> with <unk> in 98 : [MASK] to the view here [MASK] by <unk> <unk> , however , <unk> had in fact [MASK] choice with regard to his [MASK] . Faced with a major crisis , he [MASK] needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged [MASK] . The only candidate with sufficient military experience , <unk> ancestry , and [MASK] was Trajan . Likewise , Edward <unk> 's assertion that <unk> <unk> [MASK] a tradition of [MASK] through adoption among the Five Good <unk> has found little support among modern [MASK] . = = Death and legacy = = On 1 [MASK] , 98 , at the start of his [MASK] <unk> , <unk> [MASK] a stroke during a private audience . Shortly [MASK] he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the [MASK] of <unk> , on 28 [MASK] . He was deified by the Senate , and his [MASK] were laid to rest in the <unk> of Augustus . <unk> was [MASK] without incident by his adopted son Trajan , who was greeted by the Roman [MASK] with much [MASK] . According to Pliny the Younger , Trajan [MASK] a temple in honour of <unk> , yet no [MASK] of it has ever been found ; nor was a [MASK] series of coins for the <unk> <unk> issued until ten years after his death . [MASK] to <unk> <unk> , however , the Guard prefect [MASK] for the mutiny [MASK] <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was ' [MASK] ' upon Trajan 's accession . Due to the lack of [MASK] sources on this period , much of <unk> 's life has remained obscure . The most [MASK] [MASK] account of the reign of <unk> was written by the 3rd @-@ century [MASK] <unk> <unk> . His Roman History , which spans nearly a [MASK] , from the [MASK] of <unk> in Italy until the year <unk> , was [MASK] more than one hundred years after <unk> had died . Further details are added by an abridged [MASK] from the <unk> de <unk> , a work [MASK] to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century [MASK] Aurelius Victor . A more [MASK] text , presumed to describe the life of <unk> in [MASK] detail , is the <unk> , by the [MASK] historian <unk> . The <unk> is an account of the history of Rome [MASK] three [MASK] from the suicide of emperor <unk> in 69 until the death of <unk> in 96 . [MASK] , a [MASK] part of the work has been lost , with only the first five books [MASK] the Year of the Four <unk> remaining . In the [MASK] to his biography of <unk> Julius <unk> [MASK] , <unk> speaks highly of <unk> , [MASK] his reign as " the dawn of a most happy age , [ when ] <unk> [MASK] blended things once <unk> , [MASK] and freedom " . The surviving histories speak equally [MASK] of <unk> 's brief reign , although none offer a [MASK] commentary on his policies . Both <unk> <unk> and Aurelius Victor [MASK] his wisdom and <unk> , with <unk> [MASK] his decision to adopt [MASK] as his heir . These views were later [MASK] by the 18th @-@ century historian Edward <unk> in his [MASK] of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . <unk> [MASK] <unk> the first of the Five Good <unk> , five [MASK] rulers under whom the Roman Empire " was [MASK] by absolute power , under the [MASK] of wisdom and virtue " from 96 until 180 . [MASK] , even <unk> notes that , compared to his successors , <unk> may have lacked the necessary [MASK] for a [MASK] reign : Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , [MASK] <unk> as a well @-@ <unk> but weak and <unk> ruler . The Roman Senate [MASK] renewed [MASK] under his rule , but <unk> 's <unk> of the state finances and lack of [MASK] over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a [MASK] [MASK] . The mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup , but a [MASK] attempt to put [MASK] on the emperor . The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a [MASK] , reliable general as his [MASK] . <unk> concludes that <unk> 's real [MASK] were in fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> : His place in Roman history is therefore [MASK] as a necessary , if [MASK] stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ <unk> [MASK] . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work [MASK] during his reign , the <unk> of <unk> , [MASK] became known as the <unk> <unk> , or [MASK] forum .
